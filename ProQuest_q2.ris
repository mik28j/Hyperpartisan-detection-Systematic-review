AB  - It is widely reported that partisanship in the United States Congress is at an historic high. Given that individuals are persuaded to follow party lines while having the opportunity and incentives to collaborate with members of the opposite party, our goal is to measure the extent to which legislators tend to form ideological relationships with members of the opposite party. We quantify the level of cooperation, or lack thereof, between Democrat and Republican Party members in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949–2012. We define a network of over 5 million pairs of representatives, and compare the mutual agreement rates on legislative decisions between two distinct types of pairs: those from the same party and those formed of members from different parties. We find that despite short-term fluctuations, partisanship or non-cooperation in the U.S. Congress has been increasing exponentially for over 60 years with no sign of abating or reversing. Yet, a group of representatives continue to cooperate across party lines despite growing partisanship.

AB  - The present contribution maps materialist advances in media studies. Based on the assumption that matter and materiality constitute significant aspects of communication processes and practices, I introduce four fields of inquiry - technology, political economy, ecology, and the body - and argue that these perspectives enable a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of contemporary technologically afforded forms of interaction. The article shows how each perspective can balance apologetic and apocalyptic approaches to the impact of in particular digital technologies, before it demonstrates the applicability of an integrated framework with reference to the techno-politics of NSA surveillance and the counter-practices of WikiLeaks.

AB  - This study analyzes the correlation of rhetoric usage by members of Congress who were supported by the Tea Party political movement with changes in mainstream conservative political discourse. The rhetoric of these politicians after the Tea Partyâ€™s ascendance in the 2010 congressional elections was compared to the rhetoric used by the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Republican nominees to understand the correlation with other changes in conservative discourse. I studied this discourse shift using speech analysis to code for instances of negative discourse and establish a comparison between these election years while also noting rhetorical shifts evident among mainstream conservative politicians.

T1  - Google and advertising: digital capitalism in the context of Post-Fordism, the reification of language, and the rise of fake news

AB  - Googleâ€™s dominance over the web allows it to dictate various norms and practices that regulate the state of contemporary capitalism online. The way in which Google operates as a company and generates revenue is often sidelined in academic discussions regarding the cultural implications of how its search engine functions. Almost 90% of Googleâ€™s revenue is derived from advertising, despite Larry Page and Sergey Brinâ€™s original academic paper regarding Google in which they argue that advertising produces mixed motives that make it an unfeasible way to fund search engines. This article outlines how Googleâ€™s model of advertising reflects and encourages wider changes in capitalism as it shifts from its twentieth-century Fordist incarnation to contemporary Post-Fordist arrangements of labour. In doing so, this article analyses Googleâ€™s two main advertising systems, AdWords and AdSense, and proposes that these financial models have significant effects upon online discourse. In discussing AdWords, this article details some of the tensions between the local and the global that develop when tracing flows of information and capital, specifically highlighting Googleâ€™s impact on the decline of online language diversity. In outlining AdSense, this article demonstrates how Googleâ€™s hegemonic control prescribes which parts of the web can be monetised and which remain unprofitable. In particular, in drawing from existing studies, evidence is provided that Googleâ€™s AdSense programme, along with Googleâ€™s relationship with Facebook, incentivised the rise of fake news in the 2016 US presidential election. This work builds on existing scholarship to demonstrate that Googleâ€™s economic influence has varied and far-reaching effects in a number of contexts and is relevant to scholars in a range of disciplines. As such, this article is intended as a discursive introduction to the topic and does not require specific disciplinary background knowledge. In doing so, this article does not attempt to provide the final word on Googleâ€™s relationship to digital capitalism, but rather, demonstrate the profitability of a Post-Fordist perspective, in order to enable a wider engagement with the issues identified.

AB  - In the following the discussion of social media research critique has five entry points: good data, human subjects, proprietary effects, repurposing and alternatives. The first concerns how social media have oftentimes been criticized for not being â€˜good dataâ€™ at least in the sense that the fields in the databases are unstable overtime, and that the introduction of new ones leads to interactive complexity. For example, on Facebook the â€˜reactionsâ€™ that were introduced in 2016 interfered with the stability of â€˜likesâ€™, given the new choices in how to react to a post. The critique extends beyond the data fields. Even the metrics used by the corporations evolve, such as the definition of reach on Facebookâ€™s CrowdTangle, as a researcher found after publishing findings on Russian disinformation Pages on Facebook (Timberg 2017).

AB  - Today, citizens must navigate an online ecosystem wherein the pathways used to find true information are the same as those used to find false information. These pathways have also been usurped by both â€œnon-state and state actors who aim not only to disseminate misinformation but, most damaging, to erode trust in traditional sources of information.â€[1] This has created a political, national, and homeland security environment that often calls into question the very nature of truth and reality. Whatâ€™s more, outrageous conspiracy theories, once ascribed to the fringes of society, are now being normalized and incorporated into mainstream dialogues. When people talk about this problem, however, they typically point to social media, or even specifically to a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter, as if social media are solely responsible for the degradation of truth. While these platforms do seem to play a role, the internet itself has become a social platform and, through the dynamism and instructiveness of almost all websites, apps, and internet platforms, a new global infrastructure for communication, sharing, and outrage has formed. This has created an online space that, for its complex, interconnected ecosystem, requires a new paradigm for human understanding of truth and cognitive security. In 2012, one researcher—Adam Klein—recognized the potential role the totality of the internet plays in normalizing racist rhetoric; through his foundational work, we can begin to see a framework for understanding the phenomenon we are facing. In Kleinâ€™s original model, information laundering is described as the process by which â€œthe Internetâ€™s unique properties allow subversive social movements to not only grow globally, but also to quietly legitimize their causes through a borrowed network of associations.â€[2] Taking into account the amalgamation of conspiracy theories, â€œfake news,â€ propaganda, and weaponized narratives spouted by extremist groups, combined with technological advancements and a growing awareness of propagandaâ€™s effectiveness, it is perhaps time to modify this model. This thesis therefore proposes the Information Laundering 2.0 model. This research demonstrates how the interconnectedness of various internet platforms, coupled with existing and emerging online technologies, can be exploited to launder false or purposefully misleading information into public discourse at a volume and velocity previously unimaginable. It is important to study this phenomenon because this ongoing threat continues to raise difficult discussions among homeland security professionals, policymakers, and the general public, often creating an uncomfortable dialogue in which partisanship, freedom of speech, and privacy laws come into play. Nonetheless, establishing a practical framework, the Information Laundering 2.0 model, to help explain this phenomenon is a crucial step toward effective and sustainable actions to combat it. Beginning with a foundation of propaganda research, this thesis builds a new concept, dubbed counterfeit narrative, to define the content of the propaganda being spread online. The counterfeit narrative concept helps explain the flawed nature of this information and accounts for the potential actors who could leverage its use, including nation-states, terrorist organizations, domestic extremists, and even corporations engaging in disingenuous advertising campaigns. More so than terms like â€œfake newsâ€ or â€œconspiracy theories,â€ counterfeit narrative more effectively capture the nuances of the disinformation, the actors disseminating it, and the spreadability of that propaganda online. Additionally, the current internet ecosystem, including the ease with which a consumer can both find and contribute to information, creates a very influential environment. It allows truthful, important information to spread at previously impossible rates, but at the same time opens up the floodgates for the rapid spread of counterfeit narratives. Propagandists can use online technologies such as computational propaganda, echo chambers, and advertising to further cheat the internet ecosystem and create and spread content that is more influential and believable. Committed actors can leverage these techniques to intentionally undermine the credibility of legitimate sources by leveling the playing field for subversive, often extremist, content that masquerades as credible content in the public debate. Information Laundering 2.0 considers the concepts of counterfeit narrative and accelerators (technologies used to spread counterfeit narratives faster), as well as the internet ecosystem itself and actors who take advantage of existing propaganda campaigns. The model is broken into three phases: placement, layering, and integration. The placement phase prepares the information, in the form of a counterfeit narrative, for maximum impact before it is placed into the internet ecosystem. Next, in the layering phase, the counterfeit narrative is laundered through a series of domains and connections until it has reached a virality and veracity that opens it up for public discourse, without the original source or motive being understood. During the layering phase, the propagandist may take advantage of accelerators—in the form of online advertising, computational propaganda, and echo chambers—in an effort to speed up the impact of the process. Additionally, amplifiers, or actors who enhance the campaigns of other information launderers for either ideological or financial purposes, may also come into play during the layering phase. Upon successful laundering, the narrative enters the integration phase and becomes part of public discourse and knowledge. While the Information Laundering 2.0 model does not offer a simple, step-by-step solution for combating this complex problem, it helps frame the issue in a way that homeland security professionals, law enforcement, policymakers, and the general public can understand. It leverages real-world solutions at multiple levels while protecting free speech, and without sacrificing our nationâ€™s cognitive security. The Information Laundering 2.0 model should be the framework used and understood when addressing global, governmental, societal, and individual responses to this continuous threat. We must identify solutions that address the problem at every phase (placement, layering, and integration) and through every piece (enablers, accelerators, and amplifiers). Any proposed solutions for combatting information laundering should be considered with a multi-level, multi-disciplinary, and multi-sector approach. This research should therefore not be seen as the definitive guide to ending information laundering, but only as a place to start the conversation, start the research, and start the response. Solutions to be considered include identifying strategies to prevent counterfeit narratives from entering the online ecosystem all together, rebuilding trust and legitimacy of online institutions, slowing down the technology that speeds up counterfeit narratives, limiting malicious actorsâ€™ ability to amplify existing campaigns for either ideological or financial purposes, and inoculating the public against information laundering before it happens. Further, from a holistic perspective, considering access to truthful information as a right and information laundering itself as a crime may help combat the issue. Finally, restructuring our education system and the publicâ€™s awareness, especially as it relates to consumption of sources online, is also important. The United States must immediately recognize and seek to understand the concepts of counterfeit narratives and information laundering, as well as the threats they pose to democracy, freedom, and homeland security. Policymakers should tackle these issues with laws that are not too broad to limit free speech or freedom of the press, but effective enough to provide citizens with their right to be â€œsecure in their personsâ€ by establishing and defending cognitive security. Meanwhile, law enforcement and homeland security officials should make efforts to prepare for, and help mitigate, the confusion and tension that ultimately arise from these narratives and prepare to protect themselves and the general public from incidents that, without intervention, could escalate to violence.

AB  - This paper focuses on digital behaviour, self-assessment of vulnerabilities to digital disinformation, and patterns of trust as exposed by Romanian citizens. By corroborating the data of the first national public opinion survey on fake news and disinformation (implemented between February and March 2018) with the Special Eurobarometer no. 464 - Fake News and Disinformation Online - implemented in the same time frame (February 2018), we capture the perceptions and attitudes of Romanian citizens over the use of new media and news trustworthiness, and we also compare the Romanians' online behaviour with the average European's. As similar research reveals, digital disinformation affects resilience of citizens in Member States and in the European Union overall, it "threatens the democratic political processes and values" (European Commission, 2018: 12), the integrity of elections and political processes, and should therefore, be approached as a legitimate public concern. Our paper opens the floor for more dedicated research and applied policies - at both the Member States and EU levels - aimed at mitigating the rising and ever worrying fake news phenomenon.

AB  - The term "fake news" began to be widely used in the press coverage of the 2016 US presidential elections. There is much debate in the social sciences and communications fields about the applicability of this concept. We believe that the term "hyper-partisan media", which is used in part of the literature, provides a better understanding of the phenomenon. We also argue that it is important to understand that hyper-partisanship emerged as a result of the polarisation of the public sphere. In this article, we analyse the dissemination of hyper-partisan news one week before the judges' vote in the trial of former president Lula at the TRF-4 (Tribunal Regional Federal da 4a regiÃ£o, or the Federal Regional Court of the 4th Region). We show how the headlines of the stories that were shared the most on social media during that period fit into one of the two polarised narratives currently dominating the Brazilian public sphere. We conclude the article with an assessment of possible approaches to regulation on this issue.

AB  - This study explores the geographic dependencies of echo-chamber communication on Twitter during the Brexit campaign. We review the evidence positing that online interactions lead to filter bubbles to test whether echo chambers are restricted to online patterns of interaction or are associated with physical, in-person interaction. We identify the location of users, estimate their partisan affiliation, and finally calculate the distance between sender and receiver of @-mentions and retweets. We show that polarized online echo-chambers map onto geographically situated social networks. More specifically, our results reveal that echo chambers in the Leave campaign are associated with geographic proximity and that the reverse relationship holds true for the Remain campaign. The study concludes with a discussion of primary and secondary effects arising from the interaction between existing physical ties and online interactions and argues that the collapsing of distances brought by internet technologies may foreground the role of geography within oneâ€™s social network.

AB  - Conservatives and liberals have previously been shown to differ in the propensity to view socially-transmitted information about hazards as more plausible than that concerning benefits. Given differences between conservatives and liberals in threat sensitivity and dangerous-world beliefs, correlations between political orientation and negatively-biased credulity may thus reflect endogenous mindsets. Alternatively, such results may owe to the political hierarchy at the time of previous research, as the tendency to see dark forces at work is thought to be greater among those who are out of political power. Adjudicating between these accounts can inform how societies respond to the challenge of alarmist disinformation campaigns. We exploit the consequences of the 2016 U.S. elections to test these competing explanations of differences in negatively-biased credulity and conspiracism as a function of political orientation. Two studies of Americans reveal continued positive associations between conservatism, negatively-biased credulity, and conspiracism despite changes to the power structure in conservativesâ€™ favor.

AB  - This study examines the international activist movement known as Sleeping Giants, a social-media â€œcampaign to make bigotry and sexism less profitableâ€ (Sleeping Giants, n.d.). The campaign originated in the US with an anonymous Twitter account that enlisted followers in encouraging brands to pull their online advertising from Breitbart News. The campaign achieved dramatic success and rapidly spread to regions outside the US, with other anonymously run and loosely allied chapters emerging in 15 different nations (as well as a regional chapter for the EU). Many of these were initially created to take on Breitbart advertisers in their home countries, but in a number of cases they subsequently turned their attention to disrupting financial support for other far-right news media in—or impacting—their home countries. Based on interviews with leaders of eight Sleeping Giants chapters, as well as the related UK-based Stop Funding Hate campaign, this study examines the Sleeping Giants campaign with respect to its continuity with media activism of previous eras, while also seeking to understand its potential as one of the first high-profile activist campaigns to grapple with the impacts of programmatic advertising on the news ecosystem. In particular, we consider how the campaignâ€™s interventions speak to the larger debate around the normative relationship between advertising and the performance of the news ecosystem.

AB  - The present paper identifies a variety of conceptual schemes that have emerged within informing science and consider how they might be applied to fake news. The paper begins with a brief overview of fake news. This is followed presentations of various models identified in a two-volume survey of informing science. The models presented include those dealing with extrinsic (i.e., environmental) complexity, informing transitions, and individual resonance. The potential implications for informing science research into fake news are discussed and questions that may warrant future research are raised. The paper then concludes by describing what current informing science may already be telling us about fake news, its spread and its influence. Through its analysis of the fake news and informing science literature, a number of questions are identified where informing science can possibly contribute to our understanding of fake news. These include: &bull; Does fake news need to disinform its clients if it is to be effective? &bull; Why are certain groups of individuals particularly credible when it comes to communicating fake news? &bull; Under what circumstances will the emotional and social motivations to accept fake news exceed our concern for its truth? &bull; How does the nature of the fake news content and objectives impact the disinformerâ€™s choice of channel? &bull; What are the circumstances under which radically transitional fake news might have an impact?

AB  - Social media has recently become a basic source for news consumption and sharing among millions of users. Social media platforms enable users to publish and share their own generated content with little or no restrictions. However, this gives an opportunity for the spread of inaccurate or misleading content, which can badly affect usersâ€™ beliefs and decisions. This is why credibility assessment of social media content has recently received tremendous attention. The majority of the studies in the literature focused on identifying features that provide a high predictive power when fed to data mining models and select the model with the highest predictive performance given those features. Results of these studies are conflicting regarding the best model. Additionally, they disregarded the fact that real-time credibility assessment is needed and thus time and resources consumption is crucial for model selection. This study tries to fill this gap by investigating the performance of different data mining techniques for credibility assessments in terms of both functional and operational characteristics for a balanced evaluation that considers both model performance and interoperability.

AB  - Currently, the era where social media can present various facilities can answer the needs of the community for information and utilization for socio-economic interests. But the other impact of the presence of social media opens an ample space for the existence of information or hoax news about an event that is troubling the public. The hoax also provides cynical provocation, which is inciting hatred, anger, incitement to many people, directly influencing behavior so that it responds as desired by the hoax makers. Fake news is playing an increasingly dominant role in spreading Misinformation by influencing people's Perceptions or knowledge to distort their awareness and decision-making. A framework is develope dataset collection of hoax gathered using web crawlers from several websites, using classification techniques. This hoax news will be categorized into several detection parameters including, page URL, title hoax news, publish date, author, and content. Matching each word hoax using the similarity algorithm to produce the accuracy of the hoax news uses the rule-based detection method. Experiments were carried out on eleven thousand-hoax news used as training datasets and testing data sets; this data set for validation using similarity algorithms, to produce the highest accuracy of hoax text similarity. In this study, each hoax news will label into four categories, namely, Fact, Hoax, Information, Unknown. Contributions propose Automatic detection of hoax news, Automatic Multilanguage Detection, and a collection of datasets that we gather ourselves and validation that results in four categories of hoax news that have measured in terms of text similarity using similarity techniques. Further research can be continued by adding objects hate speech, black campaign, blockchain technique to ward off hoaxes, or can produce algorithms that produce better text accuracy.

AB  - The present contribution conducts an intervention in the study and practice of digital and media literacy. After reviewing key tenets of recent debates, I advance a specific understanding of the concept – critical digital literacy – that, as I argue, comprehensively addresses issues of knowledge, competencies, and skills in relation to digital technologies. In particular, I posit that critical thinking about educational and other values of â€˜the digitalâ€™ needs to take structural aspects of the technology into account that are often eschewed in instrumental or commercially-driven approaches. To prepare pupils for their future lives requires a widest possible contextualisation of technology, including issues of exploitation, commodification, and degradation in digital capitalism. Finally, I make concrete suggestions for constructive uses of technology in teaching and learning.

Our results move forward the analysis of political bots by showing that Twitterbots can be effective at rapidly generating small- to medium-sized cascades; that the retweeted content comprises user-generated hyperpartisan news, which is not strictly fake news, but whose shelf life is remarkably short; and, finally, that a botnet may be organized in specialized tiers or clusters dedicated to replicating either active users or content generated by other bots.

AB  - Reducing the spread of misinformation, especially on social media, is a major challenge. We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (â€œfake newsâ€). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans-mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans-every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media.

AB  - In the knowledge based category or what is commonly called fact-checking that uses information retrieval techniques exemplified in several research according to research [5] were research [6] that utilizes Text Runner [7] tools to obtain information from several online sources and information extraction and information indexing processes that will be compared to the inconsistency level based on questions entered by the user, then to improve the results of fake news detection, the [8] research proposes to check factual information obtained from several sources using a statistical model where the more news is discussed by several online sources, the information has more truth high. The experimental results show that the Tweet reviewer affects the source credibility. [...]research [17], showed that to eliminate false news or spam on Twitter can be done using semisupervised ranking models for scoring tweets according to their credibility on Tweets containing information relating to crisis events. The collection of corpus was obtained from streaming Twitter over a period of more than three months totaling over 1 billion tweets and has been automatically verified by humanity against 30 human annotators. Besides research in the field of journalism, RumorLens was introduced [20] which as a tool to help journalists to identify new rumors distributed via Twitter and show the audience that the information shared is a rumor and verification of the rumors which had been spread in other Tweets. The test result using large feature set between regular documents with deceptive document shows 96.6% accuracy as (F-Measure). [...]research in [23] proposed a novel time-aware ranking model that leverages on multiple sources of crowd signals.

AB  - In this brief research note, we propose a set of concepts and methods for identifying and operationalizing controversial news items. Based on an analysis of online readersâ€™ comments posted in response to political news articles in the lead-up to the most recent South Korean presidential election (May 9, 2017), we develop what we term as â€œcontroversy indicator.â€ We calculate a controversy score using the total number of reader comments and the proportion of â€œupvotesâ€ (indicating approval) and â€œdownvotesâ€ (indicating disapproval) a given news article elicits. Our findings demonstrate the potential usefulness of the controversy indicator in understanding the contemporary news environment, which is becoming increasingly divisive and polluted with disinformation.

AB  - The introduction and popularity of politically biased news sources represents a significant historical shift in the media environment, with important unexplored consequences. Evidence points to partisan segmentation in the contemporary news market, but while assumptions abound, the mechanism driving consumers to sort along party lines is unclear. I develop a framework for news choice based on perceptions of objectivity and credibility and report a test of its central mechanism using a nationally representative survey experiment. I find support for a congenial media effect, where news content from an unfamiliar source is seen as more credible and less biased when it is consistent with existing beliefs, while balanced news content may be dismissed as less credible and biased. Previous studies have examined how perceptions of bias in identical news content can change when it is attributed to different sources. In todayâ€™s media world however, access to more news sources generally and the ease with which content from those sources can be shared makes it increasingly likely people will be exposed to news content from either unknown or potentially fake news sources. This study contributes to the literature by identifying the unique effect of message content on perceptions of news bias and source credibility, while holding source constant. Paradoxically, my findings indicate that political selective exposure may arise out of individualsâ€™ genuine desire for unbiased news.

AB  - Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler was among those who expected Remain to win the EU referendum. Yet on 23 June 2016, a majority in the UK voted to Leave by a margin of 52–48%. A study of over 450 Leave voters, based on the MINDSPACE framework, looks at whether behavioural factors affected the outcome and at what lessons could be learned for any future votes. It finds that voters had low levels of knowledge which may have undermined any â€˜status quo biasâ€™; that messengers used by the Remain campaign didnâ€™t work for this audience; that the Remain campaignâ€™s loss-framed figure of &pound;4300 per household per year was judged to be less than the Leave campaignâ€™s figure of &pound;350 m a week (it is six times larger); and that behaviourally-based arguments on immigration might have had an impact. It notes how behavioural science was used successfully to increase turnout. The implication for communicators is that a â€˜Test, Learn, Adaptâ€™ strategy could be helpful in future campaigns.

AB  - With the rapid development of the internet, social media has become an essential tool for getting information, and attracted a large number of people join the social media platforms because of its low cost, accessibility and amazing content. It greatly enriches our life. However, its rapid development and widespread also have provided an excellent convenience for the range of fake news, people are constantly exposed to fake news and suffer from it all the time. Fake news usually uses hyperbole to catch peopleâ€™s eyes with dishonest intention. More importantly, it often misleads the reader and causes people to have wrong perceptions of society. It has the potential for negative impacts on society and individuals. Therefore, it is significative research on detecting fake news. In the paper, we built a model named SMHA-CNN (Self Multi-Head Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks) that can judge the authenticity of news with high accuracy based only on content by using convolutional neural networks and self multi-head attention mechanism. In order to prove its validity, we conducted experiments on a public dataset and achieved a precision rate of 95.5% with a recall rate of 95.6% under the 5-fold cross-validation. Our experimental result indicates that the model is more effective at detecting fake news.

AB  - &copy; Association for Politics and the Life Sciences 20192019Association for Politics and the Life SciencesAdequate income is a social determinant of health. In the United States, only Social Security beneficiaries receive inflation-protected guaranteed income. Social Security needs another 1983 compromise in which stakeholders accepted â€œshared painâ€ to avoid insolvency. We propose indexing the benefit using the chained consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers and providing a one-time bonus of 8% to 10% for beneficiaries in their mid-80s, when needs become greater. The chained CPI has little impact when beneficiaries start receiving benefits, but older beneficiaries need protection. The estimated 75-year savings from this restructured benefit amount to 14.2% to 18% of Social Security deficits. Modest increases in payroll taxes and maximum earnings taxed should make up most of the shortfall. Including unearned income with wages and salaries subject to the 6.2% individual tax would produce much more revenue. The discussion explores the proposalâ€™s political feasibility, grounding in current policy and political science literature, and the role of income as a social determinant of health.

AB  - We investigate the presence (and the influence) of disinformation spreading on online social networks in Italy, in the 5-month period preceding the 2019 European Parliament elections. To this aim we collected a large-scale dataset of tweets associated to thousands of news articles published on Italian disinformation websites. In the observation period, a few outlets accounted for most of the deceptive information circulating on Twitter, which focused on controversial and polarizing topics of debate such as immigration, national safety and (Italian) nationalism. We found evidence of connections between Italian disinformation sources and different disinformation outlets across Europe, U.S. and Russia, featuring similar, even translated, articles in the period before the elections. Overall, the spread of disinformation on Twitter was confined in a limited community, strongly (and explicitly) related to the Italian conservative and far-right political environment, who had a limited impact on online discussions on the up-coming elections.

AB  - This article explores the mimicking of tabloid news as a form of covert racism, relying on the credibility of an established tabloid newspaper. The qualitative case study focuses on a digital platform for letters to the editor, operated without editorial curation pre-publication from 2010 to 2018 by one of Denmarkâ€™s largest newspapers, Ekstra Bladet. A discourse analysis of the 50 most shared letters to the editor on Facebook shows that nativist, far-right actors used the platform to disseminate fear-mongering discourses and xenophobic conspiracy theories, disguised as professional news and referred to as articles. These processes took place at the borderline of true and false as well as racist and civil discourse. At this borderline, a lack of supervision and moderation coupled with the openness and visual design of the platform facilitated new forms of covert racism between journalism and user-generated content.

AB  - Nowadays, Social Media are a privileged channel for news spreading, information exchange, and fact checking. Unexpectedly for many users, automated accounts, known as social bots, contribute more and more to this process of information diffusion. Using Twitter as a benchmark, we consider the traffic exchanged, over one month of observation, on the migration flux from Northern Africa to Italy. We measure the significant traffic of tweets only, by implementing an entropy-based null model that discounts the activity of users and the virality of tweets. Results show that social bots play a central role in the exchange of significant content. Indeed, not only the strongest hubs have a number of bots among their followers higher than expected, but furthermore a group of them, that can be assigned to the same political tendency, share a common set of bots as followers. The retweeting activity of such automated accounts amplifies the hubsâ€™ messages.Twitter is becoming increasingly influential in the global political panorama. Here, the authors take a complex networks approach to study the Twitter debate around the Italian migrant crisis, finding evidence for "bots squadsâ€ amplifying the tweets of a few key political figures.

AB  - Online Social Media (OSM) have been substantially transforming the process of spreading news, improving its speed, and reducing barriers toward reaching out to a broad audience. However, OSM are very limited in providing mechanisms to check the credibility of news propagated through their structure. The majority of studies on automatic fake news detection are restricted to English documents, with few works evaluating other languages, and none comparing language-independent characteristics. Moreover, the spreading of deceptive news tends to be a worldwide problem; therefore, this work evaluates textual features that are not tied to a specific language when describing textual data for detecting news. Corpora of news written in American English, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish were explored to study complexity, stylometric, and psychological text features. The extracted features support the detection of fake, legitimate, and satirical news. We compared four machine learning algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) to induce the detection model. Results show our proposed language-independent features are successful in describing fake, satirical, and legitimate news across three different languages, with an average detection accuracy of 85.3% with RF.

AB  - With the extensive usage of social media platforms, spam information, especially rumors, has become a serious problem of social network platforms. The rumors make it difficult for people to get credible information from Internet and cause social panic. Existing detection methods always rely on a large amount of training data. However, the number of the identified rumors is always insufficient for developing a stable detection model. To handle this problem, we proposed a deep transfer model to achieve accurate rumor detection in social media platforms. In detail, an adaptive parameter tuning method is proposed to solve the negative transferring problem in the parameter transferring process. Experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate rumor detection and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rumor detection models.

AB  - If mainstream media meant one sender and inordinate receivers, nowadays, new media brought the chance and challenge to have numberless senders and receivers at the same time, in a network of information. Along with polyphonic chunks, inaccurate information penetrates the echochambers we create. The danger is that unless timely spotted, it sows disinformation and polarization. The solution resides in media literacy skills, in raising awareness over types of communication products meant for malicious use especially within social media where user generated content contributes to proliferating and spreading the content at incredible speed. The present paper is meant to present ways that help individuals avoid being subject to mal-intended behavioural and cognitive influence.

AB  - Se presenta un anÃ¡lisis de contenido de todos los bulos (N=292) relacionados con la pandemia Covid-19 identificados por las tres plataformas de verificaciÃ³n acreditadas en EspaÃ±a, durante el primer mes del estado de alarma decretado por el Gobierno (14 marzo 2020 – 13 abril 2020). El estudio muestra que los bulos sobre el coronavirus fueron diseminados principalmente en las redes sociales y, entre ellas, sobre todo en las cerradas, como la aplicaciÃ³n mÃ³vil de mensajerÃ­a WhatsApp. TambiÃ©n detecta las particularidades formales y de contenido mÃ¡s frecuentes de los contenidos falsificados. Los resultados revelan que la pandemia, ademÃ¡s de generar un gran nÃºmero de bulos sobre salud y ciencia, casi un tercio de la muestra, tambiÃ©n propiciÃ³ la difusiÃ³n de numerosos contenidos falsos de tema polÃ­tico y gubernamental. El artÃ­culo explora los formatos, fuentes y territorios de procedencia de los bulos. MÃ¡s allÃ¡ de sus resultados empÃ­ricos, este estudio realiza contribuciones teÃ³ricas en el marco de los emergentes estudios sobre desÃ³rdenes informativos. En concreto, aporta una definiciÃ³n propia de bulo, asÃ­ como una tipologÃ­a en la que se identifican cuatro tipos de bulos: broma, exageraciÃ³n, descontextualizaciÃ³n y engaÃ±o. A partir de esos cuatro tipos, se propone un â€˜diagrama de gravedad de los bulosâ€™.Alternate abstract: Drawing upon the misinformation stories debunked by the three accredited fact-checking platforms in Spain, a content analysis of all the hoaxes (N = 292) bound to the Covid-19 pandemic is performed, over the first month of the state of alarm decreed by the Spanish Government (March 14th, 2020 – April 13th, 2020). The study shows that the hoaxes about the coronavirus were disseminated mainly on social networks and, among them, especially in closed ones, such as the WhatsApp mobile messaging application. It also detects the most frequent formal and content peculiarities of misinformation. The results reveal that the pandemic, in addition to generating a large number of hoaxes on health and science, also led to the dissemination of many political fake news. The formats, sources and territories of origin of the hoaxes are also explored. Beyond the empirical results, this study makes theoretical contributions in the framework of the emerging studies on information disorders. Specifically, it provides a definition of hoax, as well as a typology in which four main types are identified: joke, exaggeration, decontextualization and deception. Based on these four types, a â€˜hoax severity diagramâ€™ is proposed.

AB  - Nowadays, Social Media are a privileged channel for news spreading, information exchange, and fact checking. Unexpectedly for many users, automated accounts, known as social bots, contribute more and more to this process of information diffusion. Using Twitter as a benchmark, we consider the traffic exchanged, over one month of observation, on the migration flux from Northern Africa to Italy. We measure the significant traffic of tweets only, by implementing an entropy-based null model that discounts the activity of users and the virality of tweets. Results show that social bots play a central role in the exchange of significant content. Indeed, not only the strongest hubs have a number of bots among their followers higher than expected, but furthermore a group of them, that can be assigned to the same political tendency, share a common set of bots as followers. The retweeting activity of such automated accounts amplifies the hubsâ€™ messages.Twitter is becoming increasingly influential in the global political panorama. Here, the authors take a complex networks approach to study the Twitter debate around the Italian migrant crisis, finding evidence for "bots squadsâ€ amplifying the tweets of a few key political figures.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 16.10.1 proposes an important monitoring agenda for the global recording of a range of violations against journalists as a means to prevent attacks on the communicative functions of journalism. However, the need for extensive collection of data on violations against journalists raises a number of methodological challenges. Our research shows the following issues must be addressed: the lack of conceptual consistency; the lack of methodological transparency; the need for sophisticated data categorisation and disaggregation to enable data to be merged from different sources; the need to establish links to understand causal and temporal relations between people and events; and the need to explore and utilize previously untapped data sources. If we are to strengthen the monitoring of SDG 16.10.1, we propose to develop a robust and reliable events-based methodology and a set of tools which can facilitate the monitoring of the full range of proposed 16.10.1 categories of violations, reconcile data from multiple sources in order to adhere to the established 16.10.1 category definitions, and to further disaggregate the proposed 16.10.1 categories to provide more in-depth information on each instance of a violations. This, we argue, will ultimately contribute towards better understanding of the contextual circumstances and processes producing aggressions against journalists.

AB  - Social media has instituted new parameters for the political conversation in the digital public sphere. Previous research had identified several of these new phenomena: political polarisation, hate speech discourses, and fake news, among others. However, little attention has been paid to the usersâ€™ geographical location, specifically to the role location plays in political discussion on social media, and to its further implications in the digital public sphere. A priori, we might think that on the digital landscape geographical restrictions no longer condition political debate, allowing increasingly diverse users to participate in, and influence, the discussion. To analyse this, machine learning techniques were used to study Twitterâ€™s political conversation about the negotiation process for the formation of the government in Spain that took place between 2015 and 2016. A big data sample of 127,3 million tweets associated with three Spanish cities (Madrid, Barcelona, and Valencia) was used. The results show that the geographical location of the users directly affects the political conversation on Twitter, despite the dissolution of the physical restrictions that the online environment favours. Demographics, cultural factors, and proximity to the centres of political power are factors conditioning the structure of digital political debate. These findings are a novel contribution to the design of more effective political campaigns and strategies, and provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the digital public sphere provided by Twitter.

AB  - Accompanying the success of the radical right and right-wing populist movements, right-wing alternative online media have recently gained prominence and, to some extent, influence on public discourse and elections. The existing scholarship so far focuses primarily on the role of content and social media distribution and pays little attention to the audiences of right-wing alternative media, especially at a cross-national level and in the European context. The present paper addresses this gap by exploring the characteristics of the audiences of right-wing alternative online media. Based on a secondary data analysis of the 2019 Reuters Digital News Survey, this article presents a cross-national analysis of right-wing alternative media use in Northern and Central Europe. The results indicate a comparatively high prevalence of right-wing alternative online media in Sweden, whereas in Germany, Austria, and Finland, these news websites seem to be far less popular. With regard to audience characteristics, the strongest predictors of right-wing alternative online media use are political interest and a critical stance towards immigration, accompanied by a skeptical assessment of news quality, in general, and distrust, especially in public service broadcasting media. Additionally, the use of social media as a primary news source increases the likelihood of right-wing alternative news consumption. This corroborates the high relevance of social media platforms as distributors and multipliers of right-wing alternative news content. The findings suggest that right-wing alternative online media should not be underestimated as a peripheral phenomenon, but rather have to be considered influential factors for center-right to radical right-leaning politics and audiences in public discourse, with a high mobilizing and polarizing potential.

AB  - In October 2019, Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Richard Clarida reflected on the impact of these headwinds on the Feďs approach to monetary policy and observed:Looking ahead, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and the [Federal Open Market] Committee will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to assess the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, and it will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective [Clarida 2019a].His "meeting-by-meeting" remark suggests that the communications tools used by the Fed to set expectations for future monetary policy-transparency and forward guidance-are less effective in this sluggish, decade-long, postcrisis economy. With rates near the effective lower bound, conventional policy tools struggle to meaningfully raise inflation and inflation expectations, a serious breach of half of the Fed's statutory mandate. Whaťs more, recent research reveals the difficulty in understanding the process that generates upside inflation pressure (Yellen 2019). Even the "workhorse" Phillips curve linking unemployment and wages struggles to explain low consumer price inflation. Absent a coherent and effective model to generate higher inflation, communication is harder still.

AB  - Political scientists have conventionally assumed that achieving democracy is a one-way ratchet. Only very recently has the question of â€œdemocratic backslidingâ€ attracted any research attention. We argue that democratic instability is best understood with tools from complexity science. The explanatory power of complexity science arises from several features of complex systems. Their relevance in the context of democracy is discussed. Several policy recommendations are offered to help (re)stabilize current systems of representative democracy.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet has forced a reformulation of communication in all areas and at all levels. Politicians and candidates have been forced to adapt to a constantly changing environment, where the rules of one-way communication are lost, but the technical possibilities and scope of the messages are multiplied. This article makes an approach to the tools and practices of technopolitics as well as the tactical and strategic use of digital tools for organization, communication and action. To this end, it highlights the main platforms linked to the Internet such as websites, social networks, instant messaging platforms, and more recently, smartphone applications for political use alone. It also analyses the current trends linked to the celebrification of the candidate, the use of memes, hashtags as a vertebral and transversal element in digital communication, the analysis of big data as the last frontier and the participation through (semi-)automated users or bots. From the point of view of communicative noise, two of the main problems of political communication are addressed, namely astroturfing - in all its variants - and fake news, linked to the increasing hate speech on digital platforms. Finally, after the analysis was carried out, the keys to understanding the politics to come, in the opinion of the authors, are proposed.Alternate abstract:La irrupciÃ³n de internet ha obligado a una reformulaciÃ³n de la comunicaciÃ³n en todos los Ã¡mbitos y a todos los niveles.

Para ello, senala las principales plataformas ligadas a internet como web, redes sociales, las plataformas de mensajerÃ­a instantÃ¡nea y, mÃ¡s recientemente, las aplicaciones para smartphone de uso exclusivamente polÃ­tico. Asimismo, se analizan las tendencias actuales ligadas a la celebrificaciÃ³n del candidato, el uso de memes, las etiquetas como elemento vertebrador y transversal en la comunicaciÃ³n digital, el anÃ¡lisis de big data como la Ãºltima frontera y la participaciÃ³n a travÃ©s de usuarios (semi)automatizados o bots. Desde el punto de vista del ruido comunicativo, se abordan dos de las principales problemÃ¡ticas de la comunicaciÃ³n polÃ­tica como son el astroturfing - en todas sus variantes - y las fake news, ligadas al creciente discurso de odio en plataformas digitales. Finalmente, y tras el anÃ¡lisis realizado, se propone lo que, a juicio de los autores, son las claves para entender la polÃ­tica que estÃ¡ por venir.Alternate abstract:A irrupÃ§Ã£o da internet forÃ§ou uma reformulaÃ§Ã£o da comunicaÃ§Ã£o em todos os Ã¡mbitos e em todos os nÃ­veis.

AB  - Individuals who encounter false information on social media may actively spread it further, by sharing or otherwise engaging with it. Much of the spread of disinformation can thus be attributed to human action. Four studies (total N = 2,634) explored the effect of message attributes (authoritativeness of source, consensus indicators), viewer characteristics (digital literacy, personality, and demographic variables) and their interaction (consistency between message and recipient beliefs) on self-reported likelihood of spreading examples of disinformation. Participants also reported whether they had shared real-world disinformation in the past. Reported likelihood of sharing was not influenced by authoritativeness of the source of the material, nor indicators of how many other people had previously engaged with it. Participantsâ€™ level of digital literacy had little effect on their responses. The people reporting the greatest likelihood of sharing disinformation were those who thought it likely to be true, or who had pre-existing attitudes consistent with it. They were likely to have previous familiarity with the materials. Across the four studies, personality (lower Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, higher Extraversion and Neuroticism) and demographic variables (male gender, lower age and lower education) were weakly and inconsistently associated with self-reported likelihood of sharing. These findings have implications for strategies more or less likely to work in countering disinformation in social media.

AB  - The identification of bots is an important and complicated task. The bot classifier "Botometer" was successfully introduced as a way to estimate the number of bots in a given list of accounts and, as a consequence, has been frequently used in academic publications. Given its relevance for academic research and our understanding of the presence of automated accounts in any given Twitter discourse, we are interested in Botometerâ€™s diagnostic ability over time. To do so, we collected the Botometer scores for five datasets (three verified as bots, two verified as human; n = 4,134) in two languages (English/German) over three months. We show that the Botometer scores are imprecise when it comes to estimating bots; especially in a different language. We further show in an analysis of Botometer scores over time that Botometer's thresholds, even when used very conservatively, are prone to variance, which, in turn, will lead to false negatives (i.e., bots being classified as humans) and false positives (i.e., humans being classified as bots). This has immediate consequences for academic research as most studies in social science using the tool will unknowingly count a high number of human users as bots and vice versa. We conclude our study with a discussion about how computational social scientists should evaluate machine learning systems that are developed for identifying bots.

AB  - In this article, we review state policy responses to the COVID‐19 pandemic and argue that they were driven primarily by partisan politics. Preliminary evidence suggests that the party affiliation of a state's Governor was the most important factor shaping the nature and timing of the response. In particular, we find that Republican Governors were less likely than their Democratic counterparts to issue stay‐at‐home orders and, when they did issue them, were slower to do so. This finding is consistent with a recent trend in U.S. health policy toward vertical partisan coalitions in which state leaders align their policies with national party leaders even when those decisions may not be in the best interest of their states or supported by a majority of their constituents. In this case, however, since President Trump's response to the outbreak has been inconsistent, many Republican Governors appear to be aligning their COVID‐19 responses with the national party's perceived rhetorical and electoral enhancing goals of personal freedom and economic growth/recovery, rather than with President.

AB  - Social media can be a double-edged sword for society, either as a convenient channel exchanging ideas or as an unexpected conduit circulating fake news through a large population. While existing studies of fake news focus on theoretical modeling of propagation or identification methods based on machine learning, it is important to understand the realistic propagation mechanisms between theoretical models and black-box methods. Here we track large databases of fake news and real news in both, Weibo in China and Twitter in Japan from different cultures, which include their traces of re-postings. We find in both online social networks that fake news spreads distinctively from real news even at early stages of propagation, e.g. five hours after the first re-postings. Our finding demonstrates collective structural signals that help to understand the different propagation evolution of fake news and real news. Different from earlier studies, identifying the topological properties of the information propagation at early stages may offer novel features for early detection of fake news in social media.

AB  - Political scientists have conventionally assumed that achieving democracy is a one-way ratchet. Only very recently has the question of â€œdemocratic backslidingâ€ attracted any research attention. We argue that democratic instability is best understood with tools from complexity science. The explanatory power of complexity science arises from several features of complex systems. Their relevance in the context of democracy is discussed. Several policy recommendations are offered to help (re)stabilize current systems of representative democracy.

AB  - The paper proposes the concept of "misinformation ecosystems" to make sense of the contemporary fake news phenomenon. Misinformation ecosystems are interconnected chains of false or misleading reports that become real in their consequences. Misinformation ecosystems are discourse communities that emerged as side effects of affective and linguistic capitalism in contemporary society. Therefore, the performative character of mutually reinforcing false reports explains the social and political impact of fake news. By exploring the manifestation of fake news in Romania, the data analysis reveals a typology of deceptive content circulated in online environments. The typology includes five analytical categories of fake news that constitutes misinformation ecosystems: "recurrent occurrences", "scapegoat offensives", "pseudoscientific gaze", "combo strikes", and "humorous hijacks". Empirical evidence supports measures against fake news that should address the social validation processes at the level of media or intermedia networks.

AB  - Political elections see several actors rise to the fore in order to influence and inform voters. Increasingly, such processes take place on social media like Facebook, where media outlets and politicians alike utilize seek promote their respective agenda. Given the recent rise of so-called hyperpartisan media—often described as purveyors of â€œfake newsâ€—and populist right-wing parties across a series of western contexts, this study details the degree to which these novel actors succeed in overtaking their more mainstream or indeed established competitors when it comes to audience engagement on the mentioned platform. Focusing on the one-month period leading up to the 2018 Swedish national elections, the study finds that right-wing actors across the media and the political sector are more successful in engaging their Facebook followers than their competitors. As audience engagement is a key factor for social media success, the study closes by providing a discussion on the repercussions for professionals within the media and the political sector.

AB  - Social media has become a popular source for online news consumption with millions of users worldwide. However, it has become a primary platform for spreading disinformation with severe societal implications. Automatically identifying social media users that are likely to propagate posts from handles of unreliable news sources sometime in the future is of utmost importance for early detection and prevention of disinformation diffusion in a network, and has yet to be explored. To that end, we present a novel task for predicting whether a user will repost content from Twitter handles of unreliable news sources by leveraging linguistic information from the userâ€™s own posts. We develop a new dataset of approximately 6.2K Twitter users mapped into two categories: (1) those that have reposted content from unreliable news sources; and (2) those that repost content only from reliable sources. For our task, we evaluate a battery of supervised machine learning models as well as state-of-the-art neural models, achieving up to 79.7 macro F1. In addition, our linguistic feature analysis uncovers differences in language use and style between the two user categories.

AB  - The epidemic spread of fake news is a side effect of the expansion of social networks to circulate news, in contrast to traditional mass media such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. Human inefficiency to distinguish between true and false facts exposes fake news as a threat to logical truth, democracy, journalism, and credibility in government institutions. In this paper, we survey methods for preprocessing data in natural language, vectorization, dimensionality reduction, machine learning, and quality assessment of information retrieval. We also contextualize the identification of fake news, and we discuss research initiatives and opportunities.

AB  - â€˜Fake newsâ€™ has been a topic of controversy during and following the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Much of the scholarship on it to date has focused on the â€˜fakenessâ€™ of fake news, illuminating the kinds of deception involved and the motivations of those who deceive. This study looks at the â€˜newsnessâ€™ of fake news by examining the extent to which it imitates the characteristics and conventions of traditional journalism. Through a content analysis of 886 fake news articles, we find that in terms of news values, topic, and formats, articles published by fake news sites look very much like traditional—and real—news. Most of their articles included the news values of timeliness, negativity, and prominence; were about government and politics; and were written in an inverted pyramid format. However, one point of departure is in terms of objectivity, operationalized as the absence of the authorâ€™s personal opinion. The analysis found that the majority of articles analyzed included the opinion of their author or authors.

AB  - This article explores audience perceptions of different types of disinformation, and the actions that users take to combat them, in three Spanish-speaking countries: Argentina, Chile, and Spain. Quantitative data from the Digital News Report (2018 and 2019), based on a survey of more than 2000 digital users from each country was used for the analysis. Results show remarkable similarities among the three countries, and how digital users identically ranked the types of problematic information that concerned them most. Survey participants were most concerned by stories where facts are spun or twisted to push a particular agenda, followed by, those that are completely made up for political or commercial reasons, and finally, they were least concerned by poor journalism (factual mistakes, dumbed-down stories, misleading headlines/clickbait). A general index of â€œConcern about disinformationâ€ was constructed using several sociodemographic variables that might influence the perception. It showed that the phenomenon is higher among women, older users, those particularly interested in political news, and among left-wingers. Several measures are employed by users to avoid disinformation, such as checking a number of different sources to see whether a news story is reported in the same way, relying on the reputation of the news company, and/or deciding not to share a news story due to doubts regarding its accuracy. This article concludes that the perceived relevance of different types of problematic information, and preventive actions, are not homogeneous among different population segments.

AB  - In the current media ecosystem, in which the traditional media coexists with new players who are able to produce information and spread it widely, there is growing concern about the increasing prominence of fake news. Despite some significant efforts to determine the effects of misinformation, the results are so far inconclusive. Previous research has sought to analyze how the public perceive the effects of disinformation. This article is set in this context, and its main objective is to investigate usersâ€™ perception of fake news, as well as identify the criteria on which their recognition strategies are based. The research pays particular attention to determining whether there are gender differences in the concern about the effects of fake news, the degree of difficulty in detecting fake news and the most common topics it covers. The results are based on the analysis of a representative survey of the Spanish population (N = 1,001) where participants were asked about their relationship with fake news and their competence in determining the veracity of the information, and their ability to identify false content were assessed. The findings show that men and womenâ€™s perception of difficulty in identifying fake news is similar, while women are more concerned than men about the pernicious effects of misinformation on society. Gender differences are also found in the topics of the false information received. A greater proportion of men receive false news on political issues, while women tend to more frequently receive fake news about celebrities.

AB  - Research typically presumes that people believe misinformation and propagate it through their social networks. Yet, a wide range of motivations for sharing misinformation might impact its spread, as well as peopleâ€™s belief of it. By examining research on motivations for sharing news information generally, and misinformation specifically, we derive a range of motivations that broaden current understandings of the sharing of misinformation to include factors that may to some extent mitigate the presumed dangers of misinformation for society. To illustrate the utility of our viewpoint we report data from a preliminary study of peopleâ€™s dis/belief reactions to misinformation shared on social media using natural language processing. Analyses of over 2,5 million comments demonstrate that misinformation on social media is often disbelieved. These insights are leveraged to propose directions for future research that incorporate a more inclusive understanding of the various motivations and strategies for sharing misinformation socially in large-scale online networks.

AB  - Digitization, digital convergence and digitalization are well-known terms that have caused a huge impact on the media landscape in the last two decades. The embedded consequences of the increase of free information online or the lack of stable profits for media companies are present in the day-to-day practices of news companies. However, there is a lack of understanding of how the emergence of new players has modified the logic and rhythm of the media production chain. In this article, we try to identify a theoretical approach to analyze and classify the different roles and actors considered to be disrupting the media stage. Through a systematic literature review of more than 200 articles published in the last twenty years, we identify and define a term to better understand the nature of these new media players: digital intermediaries. Furthermore, we argue that there is a need for a clear taxonomy regarding digital intermediaries, paying special attention to the shifts in the news companiesâ€™ definition and delivery of value.

AB  - Stereotype is a type of social bias massively present in texts that computational models use. There are stereotypes that present special difficulties because they do not rely on personal attributes. This is the case of stereotypes about immigrants, a social category that is a preferred target of hate speech and discrimination. We propose a new approach to detect stereotypes about immigrants in texts focusing not on the personal attributes assigned to the minority but in the frames, that is, the narrative scenarios, in which the group is placed in public speeches. We have proposed a fine-grained social psychology grounded taxonomy with six categories to capture the different dimensions of the stereotype (positive vs. negative) and annotated a novel StereoImmigrants dataset with sentences that Spanish politicians have stated in the Congress of Deputies. We aggregate these categories in two supracategories: one is Victims that expresses the positive stereotypes about immigrants and the other is Threat that expresses the negative stereotype. We carried out two preliminary experiments: first, to evaluate the automatic detection of stereotypes; and second, to distinguish between the two supracategories of immigrantsâ€™ stereotypes. In these experiments, we employed state-of-the-art transformer models (monolingual and multilingual) and four classical machine learning classifiers. We achieve above 0.83 of accuracy with the BETO model in both experiments, showing that transformers can capture stereotypes about immigrants with a high level of accuracy.

AB  - In recent years, we have witnessed a rise in fake news, i.e., provably false pieces of information created with the intention of deception. The dissemination of this type of news poses a serious threat to cohesion and social well-being, since it fosters political polarization and the distrust of people with respect to their leaders. The huge amount of news that is disseminated through social media makes manual verification unfeasible, which has promoted the design and implementation of automatic systems for fake news detection. The creators of fake news use various stylistic tricks to promote the success of their creations, with one of them being to excite the sentiments of the recipients. This has led to sentiment analysis, the part of text analytics in charge of determining the polarity and strength of sentiments expressed in a text, to be used in fake news detection approaches, either as a basis of the system or as a complementary element. In this article, we study the different uses of sentiment analysis in the detection of fake news, with a discussion of the most relevant elements and shortcomings, and the requirements that should be met in the near future, such as multilingualism, explainability, mitigation of biases, or treatment of multimedia elements.

AB  - IntroducciÃ³n: Tras la recomposiciÃ³n del parlamento portuguÃ©s con la apariciÃ³n de la derecha radical, este estudio explora la influencia de la orientaciÃ³n partidista en la creencia y difusiÃ³n de fake news. MetodologÃ­a: Se recurriÃ³ a una muestra exploratoria (N = 712), cuyos participantes fueron expuestos a 20 titulares polÃ­ticamente sesgados (pro-derecha y pro-izquierda): la mitad fake news y la otra mitad noticias verdaderas. Los participantes evaluaron su credibilidad y voluntad de compartirlas en las redes sociales. Resultados: Es mÃ¡s probable que los partidarios de derecha crean y compartan fake news compatibles. Esta tendencia se verificÃ³ en todos los parÃ¡metros de mediciÃ³n del partidismo -(1) intenciÃ³n de voto, (2) simpatÃ­a partidaria y (3) autoubicaciÃ³n en la escala I-D-, en contraste con lo revelado con los partidistas de izquierda. DiscusiÃ³n y conclusiones: Solo los partidarios de derecha muestran una tendencia a creer mÃ¡s en fake news que favorecen su orientaciÃ³n. No ocurre lo mismo con los individuos de izquierdas. Sin embargo, es mÃ¡s probable que tanto los partidarios de derecha como de izquierda compartan contenido sesgado. Creemos que las personas con identidad de partido de derecha pueden estar mÃ¡s expuestas a la desinformaciÃ³n en Portugal, ya que la mayorÃ­a de los sitios de desinformaciÃ³n buscan esta audiencia especÃ­fica.Alternate abstract:Introduction: After the recomposition of the Portuguese parliament with the emergence of the radical right, this study explores the influence of partisan orientation on the belief and dissemination of fake news. Methodology: An exploratory sample was used (N = 712), whose participants were exposed to 20 politically biased headlines (pro-right and pro-left): half fake news and the other half true news. Participants evaluated their credibility and willingness to share them on social media. Results: Right-wing supporters are more likely to create and share compatible fake news. This trend was verified in all the measurement parameters of partisanship ((1) voting intention, (2) partisan sympathy and (3) self-placement on the I-D scale), in contrast to what was revealed with left-wing partisans. Discussion and conclusions: Only right-wing supporters show a tendency to believe more in fake news that favors their orientation. The same is not the case with left-wing individuals. However, both right-wing and left-wing supporters are more likely to share biased content. We believe that people with a right-wing party identity may be more exposed to disinformation in Portugal, as most disinformation sites seek this specific audience.

AB  - : This article starts from the observation that popular culture resides in a contradictory space. On the one hand it seems to be thriving, in that the range of media objects that were previously studied under the rubric of popular culture has certainly expanded. Yet, cultural studies scholars rarely study these media objects as popular culture. Instead, concerns about immaterial labor, about the manipulation of voting behavior and public opinion, about filter bubbles and societal polarization, and about populist authoritarianism, determine the dominant frames with which the contemporary media environment is approached. This article aims to trace how this change has come to pass over the last 50 years. It argues that changes in the media environment are important, but also that cultural studies as an institutionalizing interdisciplinary project has changed. It identifies â€œthe moment of popular cultureâ€ as a relatively short-lived but epoch-defining moment in cultural studies. This moment was subsequently displaced by a set of related yet different theoretical problematics that gradually moved the study of popular culture away from the popular. These displacements are: the hollowing out of the notion of the popular, as signaled early on by Meaghan Morrisâ€™ article â€œThe Banality of Cultural Studiesâ€ in 1988; the institutionalization of cultural studies; the rise of the governmentality approach and a growing engagement with affect theory.

AB  - Social media platforms attempting to curb abuse and misinformation have been accused of political bias. We deploy neutral social bots who start following different news sources on Twitter, and track them to probe distinct biases emerging from platform mechanisms versus user interactions. We find no strong or consistent evidence of political bias in the news feed. Despite this, the news and information to which U.S. Twitter users are exposed depend strongly on the political leaning of their early connections. The interactions of conservative accounts are skewed toward the right, whereas liberal accounts are exposed to moderate content shifting their experience toward the political center. Partisan accounts, especially conservative ones, tend to receive more followers and follow more automated accounts. Conservative accounts also find themselves in denser communities and are exposed to more low-credibility content.Social media platforms moderating misinformation have been accused of political bias. Here, the authors use neutral social bots to show that, while there is no strong evidence for such a bias, the content to which Twitter users are exposed depends strongly on the political leaning of early Twitter connections.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has once again brought into relief and tension the delicate balancing act modern governments must strike in assuring individual liberties of its citizens, while at the same time dealing with infectious diseases and other public health risks. It is not clear how best to strike this balance, or how to judge which countries are doing an adequate job and which others are failing (on either or both fronts). What is clear, however, is that by virtue of it being available to the state, public health is based not merely on medical expertise but also on power, insofar as it part of the regulative apparatus of the administrative state which can be implemented by decree at the behest of the executive.

AB  - Disinformation is a communicative phenomenon that frequently feeds on political or electoral topics, as well as other aspects of our reality. This research takes as a case study the coverage given by the Spanish digital media to a hoax broadcast during the Filomena storm in 2021 that insisted that the snow was plastic. The purpose of this work is to analyze the instrumentalization of fake information as an expression of the information media crisis in the current context of disinformation. We set out four specific objectives: (SO1) to study the spread of the hoax through the media, (SO2) to analyze the construction of headlines in the news pieces, (SO3) to investigate the treatment of the hoax in the content of the pieces, and (SO4) to analyze the sources used in the pieces. To reflect on this phenomenon, we propose a three-dimensional model (structural, economic, and pragmatic) aimed at clarifying the relationship between the logic of the spread of hoaxes on the Internet and the role played by traditional media in their diffusion. The methodology used combines workflow techniques of digital methods with quantitative and content analyses. The results reveal the appropriation of certain communication strategies by digital newspapers aimed at obtaining visits. We conclude that the Spanish media, by adapting to the dynamics of disinformation irresponsibly encouraged by the attention economy, subscribe to and reinforce the crisis of credibility faced by the media ecosystem.

AB  - Political bots, through astroturfing and other strategies, have become important players in recent elections in several countries. This study aims to provide researchers and the citizenry with the necessary knowledge to design strategies to identify bots and counteract what international organizations have deemed botsâ€™ harmful effects on democracy and, simultaneously, improve automatic detection of them. This study is based on two innovative methodological approaches: (1) dealing with bots using hybrid intelligence (HI), a multidisciplinary perspective that combines artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, political science, and communication science, and (2) applying framing theory to political bots. This paper contributes to the literature in the field by (a) applying framing to the analysis of political bots, (b) defining characteristics to identify signs of automation in Spanish, (c) building a Spanish-language bot database, (d) developing a specific classifier for Spanish-language accounts, (e) using HI to detect bots, and (f) developing tools that enable the everyday citizen to identify political bots through framing.

AB  - Across the globe, governments restricted social life to slow the spread of COVID-19. Several conservative Protestant sects resisted these policies in the United States. We do not yet know if theology shaped the resistance or if it was more a product of a polarized national political context. We argue that the country context likely shapes how conservative Protestantsâ€™ moral worldview affects their perceptions of the pandemic and government restrictions. Countries implementing more regulations, those with limited access to healthcare, food, and other essential services, and those with past histories of epidemics may all shape residentsâ€™ perceptions. Drawing on the case of American Amish and Mennonite missionaries stationed abroad, we content-analyzed accounts of the pandemic from an international Amish and Mennonite correspondence newspaper. We found that the missionariesâ€™ perceptions of the pandemic and governmental restrictions differ from those of their U.S. counterparts, which suggests that context likely shapes how religious moral worldviews express themselves concerning public health interventions.

AB  - The increase in the connectivity and availability of network has subsequently increased the use of social media. Social Media has emerged as the most readily accessible and fastest platform for updates related to events happening worldwide. The increase in the use of social media has also increased the misuse of resources for spreading unverified information generally termed as a rumour. The biggest problem in social media is the speed at which the information spreads without verifying its credibility. There has been lot of research for detection and prevention of rumours over social media. This paper focuses on presenting the present state of the art in automatic rumour detection in social networks. The paper highlights the prominent researches done in detecting these rumours in social network over the last 5 years. This paper shows both manual and automatic approaches that can be used. Also various tools have been identified which were developed for rumour detection in social media platforms. This paper shows the different available approaches that are being used and can be used in future with improvement.

AB  - The negative impact of false information on social networks is rapidly growing. Current research on the topic focused on the detection of fake news in a particular context or event (such as elections) or using data from a short period of time. Therefore, an evaluation of the current proposals in a long-term scenario where the topics discussed may change is lacking. In this work, we deviate from current approaches to the problem and instead focus on a longitudinal evaluation using social network publications spanning an 18-month period. We evaluate different combinations of features and supervised models in a long-term scenario where the training and testing data are ordered chronologically, and thus the robustness and stability of the models can be evaluated through time. We experimented with 3 different scenarios where the models are trained with 15-, 30-, and 60-day data periods. The results show that detection models trained with word-embedding features are the ones that perform better and are less likely to be affected by the change of topics (for example, the rise of COVID-19 conspiracy theories). Furthermore, the additional days of training data also increase the performance of the best feature/model combinations, although not very significantly (around 2%). The results presented in this paper build the foundations towards a more pragmatic approach to the evaluation of fake news detection models in social networks.

AB  - ObjectivesWe investigated the association between gun ownership and perceptions about COVID-19 among Texas adults as the pandemic emerged. We considered perceived likelihood that the pandemic would lead to civil unrest, perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission and perceptions that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated.MethodsData were collected from 5 to 12 April 2020, shortly after Texasâ€™ stay-at-home declaration. We generated a sample using random digit dial methods for a telephone survey (n=77, response rate=8%) and by randomly selecting adults from an ongoing panel to complete the survey online (n=1120, non-probability sample). We conducted a logistic regression to estimate differences in perceptions by gun ownership. To account for bias associated with use of a non-probability sample, we used Bayesian data integration and ran linear regression models to produce more accurate measures of association.ResultsAmong the 60% of Texas adults who reported gun ownership, estimates of past 7-day gun purchases, ammunition purchases and gun carrying were 15% (n=78), 20% (n=100) and 24% (n=130), respectively. We found no evidence of an association between gun ownership with perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission or with perceived likelihood of civil unrest. Results from the logistic regression (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63) and the linear regression (&beta;=0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29) suggest that gun owners may be more likely to believe the threat of COVID-19 was exaggerated.ConclusionsCompared with those without guns, gun owners may have been inclined to downplay the threat of COVID-19 early in the pandemic.

AB  - : When the Eesti Konservatiivne Rahvaerakond (EKRE, Estonian Conservative Peopleâ€™s Party) took over the defunct but extensive party organisation of the Estonian Peopleâ€™s Union, it placed great emphasis on rebooting and extending the organisation and bringing in new activists. As a result, EKRE has grown into a full-fledged mass party type of organisation with all the characteristics associated to it. Furthermore, it has become the fastest-growing party in Estonia in terms of membership and been notably successful in electoral terms. This article focuses primarily on the question of how EKRE developed a mass party organisation with a strong, ideologically-devoted activist core and a remarkable presence on the ground. The article also demonstrates how the party offers a variety of opportunities for engagement to its members. In contrast to an archetypical right-wing populist party, the decision-making power is somewhat diffused within the party, though the party leader remains the public face and mouthpiece of the party. EKREâ€™s online engagement strategies have been among the most successful in recent Estonian politics and make the party stand out. The article demonstrates that parties can often revise as well as repurpose the features of the predecessor parties and even build defunct mainstream parties into mass parties with a firm ideological core.

AB  - Fake news can cause widespread and tremendous political and social influence in the real world. The intentional misleading of fake news makes the automatic detection of fake news an important and challenging problem, which has not been well understood at present. Meanwhile, fake news can contain true evidence imitating the true news and present different degrees of falsity, which further aggravates the difficulty of detection. On the other hand, the fake news speaker himself provides rich social behavior information, which provides unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this study, we propose a new hybrid deep model based on behavior information (HMBI), which uses the social behavior information of the speaker to detect fake news more accurately. Specifically, we model news content and social behavior information simultaneously to detect the degrees of falsity of news. The experimental analysis on real-world data shows that the detection accuracy of HMBI is increased by 10.41% on average, which is the highest of the existing model. The detection accuracy of fake news exceeds 50% for the first time.

AB  - In this era of technological disruption, as city dwellers change into smart city inhabitants, the perception of information via digital channels is becoming more prevalent and used for decision-making and lifestyle choices. However, the perception ot fake news or social media has resulted in poor decision-making and anxiety among smart city residents. Recognizing the importance ot filtering false information for the smart city population, this research proposed a policy and platform for filtering false information to be presented to the citizens of Sisaket Smart City. Thailand; this was to ensure the efficient and secure use ot large amounts ot citizens' information, as well as information exchange between agencies. Additionally, the study was designed to kick-start the use ot information in a smart city to make it more efficient and capable ot filtering out material that could have harmful consequences or fike news. Recognizing its significance, the researchers proposed building regulations and platforms for detecting and filtering fake news in smart cities using artificial intelligence and blockchain technology'. The findings indicated that urban inhabitants who moved into Thailand's smart cities, such as Sisaket, were highly receptive to the employment ot rules and platforms to filter fake news.

AB  - The impetus for this critique came from an email received from Mike Plugh, the president of the New York Society for General Semantics, who in response to a request for a presentation idea that could be used for a General Semantics (GS) panel talk said: "'Unity' has been the keyword bounced about during the rocky transfer of power from the Trump administration to the Biden administration. Competing definitions of the word operate across the political spectrum, some aspirational and others derisive. How does the idea of unity map onto a territory so fragmented and volatile? From a general semantics perspective, how united have the United States been historically, and what is a more reasonable map for a peaceful and prosperous future?"

AB  - The spread of false and misleading information through online social media is an elevated concern in emergency contexts such as natural disasters, where the on-the ground decision-making window is shorter, and the stakes can be particularly high. Misinformation that gets attention and is drawn out longer during and after such disasters potentially puts the affected population at additional risk. This research focuses on popular but ambiguous and contentious narratives transmitted via Twitter during Hurricane Harvey. Two most talked about contentious narratives consisted of (1) government agencies putting undocumented immigrants at risk and (2) decisions about evacuation. They depict the process of debunking, competing narratives, and political ideology that have kept the stories alive. Our findings suggest the following: that government and reporters play important roles in stemming the spread of contentious or false information; ambiguous and contentious narratives remain in the conversation longer, specific debunking works faster and reaches a larger audience than general or confused debunking; and the lack of coordination of messaging online and on the ground as well as among different government agencies may threaten the timely and accurate delivery of disaster responses.

AB  - This paper revisits the issue of partisan selectivity in the era of prevalent false, misleading, and biased information. We surveyed a representative sample of adults living in the United States to investigate the relationships among hyperpartisan news use, partisanship, and cognitive and affective involvement. First, we find that strong partisanship—from both Democrats and Republicans—relates to exposure to both left- and right-leaning hyperpartisan news. Second, exposure to left-leaning hyperpartisan content relates to negative affective involvement, while exposure to right-leaning hyperpartisan news relates to positive affective involvement. Neither left- nor right-leaning hyperpartisan news use relates to cognitive involvement, though traditional news use does. These findings add to the literature on partisan selective exposure and provide new details about the makeup of news audiences and their cognitive and affective involvement with hyperpartisan news.

AB  - Individuals who score highly in EQ should be better at understanding and regulating their own emotions, and importantly, the emotional content of news items that appear on their social media feed. [...]in the present study, we investigate whether individuals who exhibit high levels of emotional intelligence (i.e. high EQ) are more likely to see through the emotionally charged content found in fake news items. [...]participantâ€™s responses to our news items combine their judgements of the itemâ€™s objectivity, professionalism, argument strength and overall trustworthiness/credibility, rather than the 2AFC (i.e. is this real or fake news) used in previous research. [...]research has shown that emotional intelligence is positively correlated with academic achievement [39–41], and so here we seek to replicate that effect and assess whether it extends to fake news detection ability. Participants An a-priori G*Power analysis with an assumed medium effect size of.30, power set at.80 and an alpha of.05, suggested that a sample size of 67 participants was required to detect an effect in this study. [...]to ensure adequate statistical power, we recruited 104 participants for this study. 17 participants were removed from the final dataset as they did not complete all aspects of the study, and so the final sample consisted of 87 participants (55 Female).

AB  - Why is misleading partisan content believed and shared? An influential account posits that political partisanship pervasively biases reasoning, such that engaging in analytic thinking exacerbates motivated reasoning and, in turn, the acceptance of hyperpartisan content. Alternatively, it may be that susceptibility to hyperpartisan content is explained by a lack of reasoning. Across two studies using different participant pools(total N = 1,973 Americans), we had participants assess true, false, and hyperpartisan news headlines taken from social media. We found no evidence that analytic thinking was associated with judging politically consistent hyperpartisan or false headlines to be accurate and unbiased. Instead, analytic thinking was, in most cases, associated with an increased tendency to distinguish true headlines from both false and hyperpartisan headlines (and was never associated with decreased discernment).These results suggest that reasoning typically helps people differentiate between low and high qual-ity political news, rather than facilitate belief in misleading content. Because social media play an important role in the dissemination of misinformation, we also investigated willingness to share headlines on social media. We found a similar pattern whereby analytic thinking was not generally associated with increased willingness to share hyperpartisan or false headlines. Together, these results suggest a positive role for reasoning in resisting misinformation.

AB  - If the 2016 presidential election began an era of especially unbridled political rancor in the US, North Carolinians were ahead of the curve by Nov 2010, when elections awarded Republicans the majority in both chambers of the General Assembly for the first time in 141 years. And as was true on the national political stage, environmental issues in North Carolina often split the legislature down the aisle. So as the new Republican majority began to develop environmental policy initiatives for issues including coastal management, domestic energy (e.g., offshore exploration and production, onshore shale gas, and coal ash), and broad regulatory reform, to name just a few, the agenda for holding environmental science hostage to hyperpartisan rancor was fully developed. And then, a miracle happened. In 2016, the Republican-led General Assembly authorized the creation of the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory. The initiative was spearheaded by Senate leader Phil Berger, in response to public suggestions that the expertise within the University of North Carolina System should be called on to help address state and local policy challenges. Berger's goal was to have a direct contact at UNC to answer questions and make policy recommendations.

AB  - In this article, we analyze the spread of political disinformation in events of discursive struggles on Twitter, during the 2018 presidential election in Brazil. These were disputes for the hegemonic narrative between two stories based on opposed hashtags: one based on news from mainstream media and the other, based on disinformation, mostly from hyperpartisan outlets. Our goal was to understand how hyperpartisan outlets created and shaped these discursive struggles and the strategies used to spread disinformation to create an â€œalternative narrativeâ€ to the facts. Our case study is focused on two discursive struggles, for which we will use critical discourse analysis and social network analysis. Our findings suggest that (1) the structure of the hashtag wars was very polarized and right-wing groups had higher exposure to hyperpartisan content and disinformation, while traditional media discourse circulates more among other different ideological clusters; (2) right-wing hyperpartisan media mostly used biased framing and polarized ideological discourse structure as manipulative strategies to reframe the events and create a counter-narrative (and thus, to create the dispute); and (3) opinion leaders were major spreaders of disinformation among far-right users, as they reinforced hyperpartisan content and became key actors in the discursive struggles (and thus, reinforced the dispute).

AB  - This study investigates how successful Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) Twitter accounts constructed the followings that were central to their disinformation campaigns around the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Treating an accountâ€™s social media following as both an ego network and an audience critical for information diffusion and influence accrual, we situate IRA Twitter accountsâ€™ accumulation of followers in the ideologically polarized, attention driven, and asymmetric political communication system. Results show that partisan enclaves on Twitter contributed to IRA accountsâ€™ followings through retweeting; and that mainstream and hyperpartisan media assisted conservative IRA accountsâ€™ following gain by embedding their tweets in news. These results illustrate how network dynamics within social media and news media amplification beyond it together boosted social media followings. Our results also highlight the dynamics fanning the flames of disinformation: partisan polarization, media fragmentation and asymmetry, and an attention economy optimized for engagement rather than accuracy.

AB  - The evolution of electronic media is a mixed blessing. Due to the easy access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious problem that causes disputes and endangers the societal stability and harmony. Fake news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature. proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news, paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of the news at the early stage i.e., when the news is published but is yet to be disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary, we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection. The experiment conducted on the real-world dataset indicates that our model outperforms the previous work and enables fake news detection with an accuracy of 95.32%.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a great deal of concern about the proliferation of false and misleading news on social media1-4. Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5-7. Here, we attempt to address both ofthese questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.

AB  - In July 2017, a law aimed at reversing the decline in vaccination cover (Law 119/2017) made child vaccination mandatory in Italy. The law sparked a heated debate which was a breeding ground for disinformation and misinformation but also set the stage for some initiatives that have tried to combat the problem. This paper analyzes the Twitter vaccine-related information environment by focusing on the information sources shared by about 500,000 tweets published within three years - 18 months before and after the promulgation of the Law 119/2017 on mandatory vaccinations - highlighting clusters of sources shared by the users and changes in problematic and quality information throughout that period. Results show that the politicization of the topic was associated with the growing spread of problematic information. They expose the vaccine-related information environment as characterized by an homophilic and polarized structure grouping together and opposing, on the one hand, anti-vaccination, blacklisted sources, alternative therapy and conspiracy websites, and on the other, scientific and health sources, revealing that despite the new initiatives aimed at increasing quality information and fighting problematic information online, there was a lack of scientific information both during and after the debate on the vaccinations law, while problematic information appears to have increased in volume over the years.

AB  - Online media sites such as Breitbart News in the United States and The Canary in the United Kingdom have come to prominence as powerful new agents. Their reach and influence in the contemporary digital media ecology have been widely highlighted, yet there has been little scholarship to situate these important new players in the field of political communication. This article argues that, first, these â€˜interlopersâ€™ known as the â€˜alt-rightâ€™ and â€˜alt-leftâ€™ need to be understood as embedded in the context of populist politics. Second, â€˜hyperpartisanâ€™ describes these sites better than the framework of alternative media as it mirrors populismâ€™s ideological pillar of â€˜usâ€™ versus â€˜themâ€™. Finally, a deliberate provocation is argued to name these digital start-ups as news to create a starting point for conceptualising these disruptive new media forces.

AB  - This work studies the use of disinformation to construct an image of otherness through the internet. We applied a content analysis methodology to the 161 racist, xenophobic or Islamophobic fake news pieces that were discredited in 2020 by the four Spanish information verification media entities accredited by the International Fact-Checking Network: Maldita.es, Newtral, Efe Verifica and Verificat. The results show that the most commonly used formats were image and video, that disinformation was most often based on taking information out of context and deception, and that the source could not be identified. The most shared characteristics associated otherness with receiving aid, violence and illegal immigration. The most commonly used images were photographs, which mostly showed people in a general manner (not individually). Despite this, disinformation was not generated by manipulating images, but by inserting text over images. The use of supposed screenshots to create fictitious references or take truthful screenshots out of context was also notable.Alternate abstract:Este trabajo estudia la construcciÃ³n de la imagen de la otredad a travÃ©s de la desinformaciÃ³n en Internet. Para ello, aplica una metodologÃ­a de anÃ¡lisis de contenido a los 161 bulos de carÃ¡cter racista, xenÃ³fobo o islamÃ³fobo desmentidos en 2020 por los cuatro medios espaÃ±oles de verificaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n acreditados por la International Fact-Checking Network: Maldita.es, Newtral, Efe Verifica y Verificat. Los resultados evidencian que los formatos mÃ¡s empleados fueron la imagen y el vÃ­deo, y que las desinformaciones se basaron mayoritariamente en la descontextualizaciÃ³n y el engaÃ±o, sin identificar su fuente. Los atributos mÃ¡s transmitidos asociaron la otredad a la recepciÃ³n de ayudas, la violencia y la inmigraciÃ³n irregular. Las imÃ¡genes mÃ¡s empleadas fueron las fotografÃ­as, que mayoritariamente representaron a las personas de manera no individualizada; sin embargo, la desinformaciÃ³n no se produjo a travÃ©s de la manipulaciÃ³n visual, sino de la inserciÃ³n de texto. TambiÃ©n fue notable la difusiÃ³n de supuestas capturas de pantalla, aprovechadas para crear referentes ficticios o descontextualizar otros realmente existentes.Alternate abstract:Aquest treball estudia la construcciÃ³ de la imatge de lâ€™alteritat a travÃ©s de la desinformaciÃ³ a Internet.

AB  - Like other disease outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid generation and dissemination of misinformation and fake news. We investigated whether subscribers to a fact checking newsletter (n = 1397) were willing to share possible misinformation, and whether predictors of possible misinformation sharing are the same as for general samples. We also investigated predictors of willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine and found that although vaccine acceptance was high on average, it decreased as a function of lower belief in science and higher conspiracy mentality. We found that 24% of participants had shared possible misinformation and that this was predicted by a lower belief in science. Like general samples, our participants were typically motivated to share possible misinformation due to interest in the information, or to seek a second opinion about claim veracity. However, even if information is shared in good faith and not for the purpose of deceiving or misleading others, the spread of misinformation is nevertheless highly problematic. Exposure to misinformation engenders faulty beliefs in others and undermines efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 by reducing adherence to social distancing measures and increasing vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - This paper describes the VaxxStance task at IberLEF 2021. The task proposes to detect stance in Tweets referring to vaccines, a relevant and controversial topic in the current pandemia. The task is proposed in a multilingual setting, providing data for Basque and Spanish languages. The objective is to explore crosslingual approaches which also complement textual information with contextual features obtained from the social network. The results demonstrate that contextual information is crucial to obtain competitive results, especially across languages.Alternate abstract:En este artÃ­culo se describe la tarea VaxxStance celebrada en el marco de IberLEF 2021.

AB  - The paper presents a qualitative study of fake news on Polish-language internet media that seeks to arrive at their thematic classification in order to identify areas particularly vulnerable to disinformation in Poland. Fake news examples from 2019 were selected using popular Polish fact-checking sites (N = 192) and subjected to textual analysis and coding procedure to establish the thematic categories and specific topics most often encountered in this type of disinformation, with the following thematic categories identified in the process: political and economic; social; gossip/rumour; extreme; pseudo-scientific; worldview; historical; and commercial. The study culminates in a critical interpretation of results and discussion of the phenomenon in its Polish and international contexts. Among discussed conclusions is the dominance of content related to the government, Catholic Church, and LGBT issues in the Polish context, as well as the longevity of health-based fake news, especially anti-vaccination content, that points to the global impact of fake news and calls for action to prevent its spread.

AB  - This research characterizes risk perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccines based on the dread and unknown dimensions of the psychometric paradigm. We examine if mental risk comparisons of these two risk objects influence risk mitigation behaviors (vaccination intention; vaccine acceptance; preventive behaviors) and emotional responses among unvaccinated and vaccinated Americans. A survey (N = 1532) was conducted based on a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults in May 2021. Results reveal considerable impact of risk comparison, especially along the dread dimension, on the outcomes of interest. In essence, this research reveals critical insights regarding vaccine hesitancy and risk communication about vaccination.

AB  - Fact-checking and warnings of misinformation are increasingly salient and prevalent components of modern news media and political communications. While many warnings about political misinformation are valid and enable people to reject misleading information, the quality and validity of misinformation warnings can vary widely. Replicating and extending research from the fields of social cognition and forensic psychology, we find evidence that valid retrospective warnings of misleading news can help individuals discard erroneous information, although the corrections are weak. However, when informative news is wrongly labeled as inaccurate, these false warnings reduce the newsâ€™ credibility. Invalid misinformation warnings taint the truth, lead individuals to discard authentic information, and impede political memory. As only a few studies on the tainted truth effect exist, our research helps to illuminate the less explored dark side of misinformation warnings. Our findings suggest general warnings of misinformation should be avoided as indiscriminate use can reduce the credibility of valid news sources and lead individuals to discard useful information.

AB  - Credibility is a crucial element for journalism. As fake news impacts credibility, it affects the general public, policymakers, decision-makers, and the journalistic environment. However, current research on fake news using content-based approaches focuses majorly on one or two dimensions of stylometrics, semantic and linguistic processes, but not on these three simultaneously. Considering that content-based detection of fake news would benefit from a multidimensional approach because of their inherent characteristics, we proposed a method that uses all of these dimensions to improve classification accuracy, using a voting ensemble designed in an ensemble classifier form. The results show that the multidimensional voting classifier has produced more accurate results than its peers while being more sensitive to distinguish between true and false news when using randomized data.

AB  - Background Although fake news creation and consumption are mutually related and can be changed to one another, our review indicates that a significant amount of research has primarily focused on news creation. To mitigate this research gap, we present a comprehensive survey of fake news research, conducted in the fields of computer and social sciences, through the lens of news creation and consumption with internal and external factors. Methods We collect 2,277 fake news-related literature searching six primary publishers (ACM, IEEE, arXiv, APA, ELSEVIER, and Wiley) from July to September 2020. These articles are screened according to specific inclusion criteria (see Fig 1). Eligible literature are categorized, and temporal trends of fake news research are examined. Results As a way to acquire more comprehensive understandings of fake news and identify effective countermeasures, our review suggests (1) developing a computational model that considers the characteristics of news consumption environments leveraging insights from social science, (2) understanding the diversity of news consumers through mental models, and (3) increasing consumersâ€™ awareness of the characteristics and impacts of fake news through the support of transparent information access and education. Conclusion We discuss the importance and direction of supporting oneâ€™s â€œdigital media literacyâ€ in various news generation and consumption environments through the convergence of computational and social science research.

AB  - To alleviate the impact of fake news on our society, predicting the popularity of fake news posts on social media is a crucial problem worthy of study. However, most related studies on fake news emphasize detection only. In this paper, we focus on the issue of fake news influence prediction, i.e., inferring how popular a fake news post might become on social platforms. To achieve our goal, we propose a comprehensive framework, MUFFLE, which captures multi-modal dynamics by encoding the representation of news-related social networks, user characteristics, and content in text. The attention mechanism developed in the model can provide explainability for social or psychological analysis. To examine the effectiveness of MUFFLE, we conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms both state-of-the-art methods of popularity prediction and machine-based baselines in top-k NDCG and hit rate. Through the experiments, we also analyze the feature importance for predicting fake news influence via the explainability provided by MUFFLE.

AB  - Social media represent an important source of news for many users. They are, however, affected by misinformation and they might be playing a role in the growth of political polarization. In this paper, we create an agent based model to investigate how policing content and backlash on social media (i.e. conflict) can lead to an increase in polarization for both users and news sources. Our model is an advancement over previously proposed models because it allows us to study the polarization of both users and news sources, the evolution of the audience connections between users and sources, and it makes more realistic assumptions about the starting conditions of the system. We find that the tendency of users and sources to avoid policing, backlash and conflict in general can increase polarization online. Specifically polarization comes from the ease of sharing political posts, intolerance for opposing points of view causing backlash and policing, and volatility in changing oneâ€™s opinion when faced with new information. On the other hand, it seems that the integrity of a news source in trying to resist the backlash and policing has little effect.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media served as an important channel for the public to obtain health information and disseminate opinions when offline communication was severely hindered. Yet the emergence of social bots influencing social media conversations about public health threats will require researchers and practitioners to develop new communication strategies considering their influence. So far, little is known as to what extent social bots have been involved in COVID-19 vaccine-related discussions and debates on social media. This work selected a period of nearly 9 months after the approval of the first COVID-19 vaccines to detect social bots and performed high-frequency word analysis for both social bot-generated and human-generated tweets, thus working out the extent to which social bots participated in the discussion on the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter and their participation features. Then, a textual analysis was performed on the content of tweets. The findings revealed that 8.87% of the users were social bots, with 11% of tweets in the corpus. Besides, social bots remained active over three periods. High-frequency words in the discussions of social bots and human users on vaccine topics were similar within the three peaks of discourse.

AB  - : This article outlines a first attempt at analysing counter-media publishing through the lens of remix theory. We concentrate on two key concepts—appropriation and authorship—which have a permanent standing in the remix research literature. To support our theoretical analysis, we investigate the coverage of two cases in the Finnish right-wing counter-media online publication MV-lehti. Our findings enable new readings on the nature of both counter-media work and remix culture. In fact, counter-media publishing leans more in the direction of remix culture—which is based on the act of using pre-existing materials to produce something new—than towards traditional journalistic convention, with its rules and ethical guidelines. MV-lehtiâ€™s practice of combining and layering different material is discernibly political, often resembling media activism. Our study provides the argument that counter to the utopian democratising assumptions of remix culture, the proliferation of remix practices has also given antidemocratic actors the means to challenge collectively and institutionally supported ideas of knowledge and justice. Counter-media publishing is perhaps democratising in that it offers the means to participate, but these antagonistic actors also remix news to undermine liberal-democratic ideals and social justice. Evidently, remix practices can be co-opted for a reactionary agenda.

AB  - Prior studies have theorized a positive association between peopleâ€™s populist attitudes and an increased use of social media to consume news, which will be mainly driven by individualsâ€™ engagement with news that reflects their people-centered, anti-elitist, and Manichean understanding of politics. However, such general connection remains elusive. This research seeks to further clarify this strand of the literature by incorporating peopleâ€™s belief that important political information will find them without actively seeking news—"News Finds Meâ€ perception (NFM). For that, we use online survey data from two European countries that differ regarding the ideological political supply side of populism (Italy and Portugal). The main results suggest that citizens who hold stronger populist attitudes will also develop stronger NFM. Furthermore, findings reveal a mediating effect of social media news use on the effects of populist attitudes over NFM. That is, those who hold stronger populist attitudes tend to use social media to get exposed to public affairs news more often, which in turn explains the development of the NFM. These results emphasize the importance of systematically exploring citizens populistsâ€™ attitudes within todayâ€™s social media, social networks, and complex information systems.

AB  - In this digital era, people rely on the internet for their news consumption. As people are free to express their opinions on social media, much information shared on the internet is loaded with propaganda. Propagandist contents are intended to influence public opinion. In the mainstream media or prominent news agencies, the authorsâ€™ and news agenciesâ€™ own bias may impact in the news contents. Hence, it is required to detect such propaganda spread through news articles. Detection and classification of propagandist text require standard, high-quality, annotated datasets. A few datasets are available for propaganda classification. However, these datasets are mostly in English. Hindi is the most spoken language in India, and efforts are needed to detect its propagandist contents. This research work introduces two new datasets: H-Prop and H-Prop-News, which consist of news articles in Hindi annotated as propaganda or non-propaganda. The H-Prop dataset is generated by translating 28,630 news articles from the QProp dataset. The H-Prop-News dataset contains 5500 news articles collected from 32 prominent Hindi news websites. We experiment with the proposed datasets using four supervised machine learning models combined with different feature vectors and word embeddings. Our experiments achieve 87% accuracy using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF feature vectors. The datasets provide high-quality labeled news articles in Hindi and open new avenues for researchers to explore techniques for analyzing and classifying propaganda in Hindi text.Dataset:https://zenodo.org/record/5828240#.YduLv2hBxPY.Dataset License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International

AB  - Nowadays, an increasing portion of our lives is spent interacting online through social media platforms, thanks to the widespread adoption of the latest technology and the proliferation of smartphones. Obtaining news from social media platforms is fast, easy, and less expensive compared with other traditional media platforms, e.g., television and newspapers. Therefore, social media is now being exploited to disseminate fake news and false information. This research aims to build the FakeAds corpus, which consists of tweets for product advertisements. The aim of the FakeAds corpus is to study the impact of fake news and false information in advertising and marketing materials for specific products and which types of products (i.e., cosmetics, health, fashion, or electronics) are targeted most on Twitter to draw the attention of consumers. The corpus is unique and novel, in terms of the very specific topic (i.e., the role of Twitter in disseminating fake news related to production promotion and advertisement) and also in terms of its fine-grained annotations. The annotation guidelines were designed with guidance by a domain expert, and the annotation is performed by two domain experts, resulting in a high-quality annotation, with agreement rate F-scores as high as 0.815.

AB  - Online content trustworthiness has become a topic of significant interest due to the growth of so-called â€˜fake newsâ€™ and other deceptive online content. Deceptive content has been responsible for an armed standoff, caused mistrust surrounding elections and reduced the trust in media, generally. Modern society, though, depends on the ability to share information to function. Citizens may be injured if they donâ€™t heed medical, weather and other emergency warnings. Distrust for educational information impedes the transfer of knowledge of innovations and societal growth. To function properly, societal trust in shared in information is critical. This article seeks to understand the problem and possible solutions. It assesses the impact of the characteristics of online articles and their authors, publishers and sponsors on perceived trustworthiness to ascertain how Americans make online article trust decisions. This analysis is conducted with a focus on how the impact of these factors on trustworthiness varies based on individualsâ€™ age, education and gender.

AB  - DefinitionCurrent literature on fake news is rather abundant and mainly focused on history, variety, and types, rather than processes. This review draws on current literature to build a working definition of fake news focused on its present relevance to journalism and political communication contemporary debate, distinguishing it from non-pertinent conceptual varieties and contributing to a much-needed clarification on the subject. We performed a qualitative analysis of the literature published between 2016 and 2020. Data were extracted from Web of Science and Scopus. We define fake news as a type of online disinformation with misleading and/or false statements that may or may not be associated with real events, intentionally designed to mislead and/or manipulate a specific or imagined public through the appearance of a news format with an opportunistic structure (title, image, content) to attract the readerâ€™s attention in order to obtain more clicks and shares and, therefore, greater advertising revenue and/or ideological gain.

AB  - Interventions that shift users attention toward the concept of accuracy represent a promising approach for reducing misinformation sharing online. We assess the replicability and generalizability of this accuracy prompt effect by meta-analyzing 20 experiments (with a total N&thinsp;=&thinsp;26,863) completed by our group between 2017 and 2020. This internal meta-analysis includes all relevant studies regardless of outcome and uses identical analyses across all studies. Overall, accuracy prompts increased the quality of news that people share (sharing discernment) relative to control, primarily by reducing sharing intentions for false headlines by 10% relative to control in these studies. The magnitude of the effect did not significantly differ by content of headlines (politics compared with COVID-19 related news) and did not significantly decay over successive trials. The effect was not robustly moderated by gender, race, political ideology, education, or value explicitly placed on accuracy, but was significantly larger for older, more reflective, and more attentive participants. This internal meta-analysis demonstrates the replicability and generalizability of the accuracy prompt effect on sharing discernment.Prompting people to consider accuracy can improve the quality of news they share online. Here, using an internal meta-analysis, the authors show that this effect is replicable and generalizes across headlines, types of accuracy prompt, and various participant characteristics.

AB  - Deceptive online content represents a potentially severe threat to society. This content has shown to have the capability to manipulate individualsâ€™ beliefs, voting and activities. It is a demonstrably effective way for foreign adversaries to create domestic strife in open societies. It is also, by virtue of the magnitude of content, very difficult to combat. Solutions ranging from censorship to inaction have been proposed. One solution that has been suggested is labeling content to indicate its accuracy or characteristics. This would provide an indication or even warning regarding content that may be deceptive in nature, helping content consumers make informed decisions. If successful, this approach would avoid limitations on content creatorsâ€™ freedom of speech while also mitigating the problems caused by deceptive content. To determine whether this approach could be effective, this paper presents the results of a national survey aimed at understanding how content labeling impacts online content consumption decision making. To ascertain the impact of potential labeling techniques on different portions of the population, it analyzes labelsâ€™ efficacy in terms of income level, political party affiliation and online usage time. This, thus, facilitates determining whether the labeling may be effective and also aids in understating whether its effectiveness may vary by demographic group.

AB  - Lying is an integral part of everyday communication in both written and oral forms. Detecting lies is therefore essential and has many possible applications. Our study aims to investigate the performance of automated lie detection methods, namely the most recent breed of pre-trained transformer neural networks capable of processing the Polish language. We used a dataset of nearly 1500 true and false statements, half of which were transcripts and the other half written statements, originating from possibly the largest study of deception in the Polish language. Technically, the problem was posed as text classification. We found that models perform better on typed than spoken utterances. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 0.69, which is much higher than the human performance average of 0.56. For transcribed utterances, human performance was at 0.58 and the models reached 0.62. We also explored model interpretability based on integrated gradient to shed light on classifier decisions. Our observations highlight the role of first words and phrases in model decisions, but more work is needed to systematically explore the observed patterns.

AB  - Fake news and disinformation are not a new phenomenon. However, in recent years, they have acquired great prominence on the public agenda, conditioning electoral results and generating episodes of political destabilization. Academic interest runs in parallel with the consideration of disinformation as a growing priority for governments and international organizations, due to its geostrategic relevance and its importance for national sovereignty and security. The interference of countries such as Russia or China in other nationsâ€™ electoral processes, using new tools and methods to manipulate public opinion and proliferate cyberattacks have led to the creation of agencies or regulations aimed at curbing disinformation in some states. The UN, the EU and other countriesâ€™ governments have tried to develop strategies to respond to this growing threat. The pandemic has accelerated the decline of local media, which leaves communities in a state of serious vulnerability. Reliable resources and sources around local information are scarce assets, information is increasingly consumed through social media, and in them disinformation easily proliferates. With this proposal, we intend to start a discussion around disinformation at a local level, something that has been absent in disinformation studies.

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet, social media has become a convenient online platform for users to obtain information, express opinions, and communicate with each other. Users are keen to participate in discussions on hot topics and exchange opinions on social media. A lot of fake news has also arisen at this moment. However, existing fake news detection methods have the problem of relying too much on textual features. Textual features are easy to be tampered with and deceive the detector; thus, it is difficult to distinguish fake news only by relying on textual features. To address the challenge, we propose a fake news detection method based on the diffusion growth rate (Delta-G). To identify the real and fake news, Delta-G uses graph convolutional networks to extract the diffusion structure features and then adopts the long-short-term memory networks to extract the growth rate features on time series. In the experiments, Delta-G is verified on two news datasets, Twitter and Weibo. Compared with the three detection methods of decision tree classifier, support vector machines with a propagation tree kernel, and RvNN, the accuracy of the Delta-G on the two datasets is improved by an average of 5% or more, which is better than all the baselines.

AB  - Social media platforms like Twitter have become common tools for disseminating and consuming news because of the ease with which users can get access to and consume it. This paper focuses on the identification of false news and the use of cutting-edge detection methods in the context of news, user, and social levels. Fake news detection taxonomy was proposed in this research. This study examines a variety of cutting-edge methods for spotting false news and discusses their drawbacks. It also explored how to detect and recognize false news, such as credibility-based, time-based, social context-based, and the substance of the news itself. Lastly, the paper examines various datasets used for detecting fake news and proposed an algorithm.

AB  - Social media fake news has become a pervasive and problematic issue today with the development of the internet. Recent studies have utilized different artificial intelligence technologies to verify the truth of the news and provide explanations for the results, which have shown remarkable success in interpretable fake news detection. However, individualsâ€™ judgments of news are usually hierarchical, prioritizing valuable words above essential sentences, which is neglected by existing fake news detection models. In this paper, we propose an interpretable novel neural network-based model, the hierarchical co-attention selection network (HCSN), to predict whether the source post is fake, as well as an explanation that emphasizes important comments and particular words. The key insight of the HCSN model is to incorporate the Gumbel–Max trick in the hierarchical co-attention selection mechanism that captures sentence-level and word-level information from the source post and comments following the sequence of words–sentences–words–event. In addition, HCSN enjoys the additional benefit of interpretability—it provides a conscious explanation of how it reaches certain results by selecting comments and highlighting words. According to the experiments conducted on real-world datasets, our model outperformed state-of-the-art methods and generated reasonable explanations.

AB  - Stylometry has gained great popularity in digital humanities and social sciences. Many works on stylometry have recently been reported. However, there is a research gap regarding review studies in this field from a bibliometric and evolutionary perspective. Therefore, in this paper, a bibliometric analysis of publications from the Scopus database in the stylometric research field was proposed. Then, research articles published between 1968 and 2021 were collected and analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package for bibliometric analysis via the Biblioshiny web interface. Empirical results were also presented in terms of the performance analysis and the science mapping analysis. From these results, it is concluded that there has been a strong growth in stylometry research in recent years, while the USA, Poland, and the UK are the most productive countries, and this is due to many strong research partnerships. It was also concluded that the research topics of most articles, based on author keywords, focused on two broad thematic categories: (1) the main tasks in stylometry and (2) methodological approaches (statistics and machine learning methods).

AB  - As consumption of mainstream news media declines and alternative news media proliferates, in this paper, we seek to assess the impact of digital alternative news media (DANM) in relation to mainstream news media (MNM). We examine the range of DANM, especially public Facebook pages, related to two large-scale social movements neighbouring mainland China as case studies of social movement media exerting maximalist effects. The assessment relies on academic sources, archival materials, descriptive social media metrics, and an original analysis of external content shared on public Facebook pages and groups using data collected from the Facebook Graph API. A six-dimensional scheme is proposed to guide the assessment. Sorting through and piecing together multiple sources, we arrive at a multi-faceted description, comparison, and analysis of the impact of DANM during two social movements.

AB  - Two studies (one preregistered) of Americans (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;2200) drawn from a nationally representative panel show that both Democrats and Republicans personally value core democratic characteristics, such as free and fair elections, but severely underestimate opposing party membersâ€™ support for those same characteristics. Democrats estimate that the average Democrat values democratic characteristics 56% (in Study 1) and 77% (in Study 2) more than the average Republican. In a mirror image, Republicans estimate that the average Republican values democratic characteristics 82% (in Study 1) and 88% (in Study 2) more than the average Democrat. In turn, the tendency to believe that political ingroup members value democratic characteristics more than political outgroup members is associated with support for anti-democratic practices, especially among Republicans. Results suggest biased and inaccurate intergroup perceptions may contribute to democratic erosion in the United States.

AB  - Online rumors spread rapidly through social media, which is a great threat to public safety. Existing solutions are mainly based on content features or propagation structures for rumor detection. However, due to the variety of strategies in creating rumors, only considering certain features cannot achieve good enough detection results. In addition, existing works only consider the rumor propagation structure and ignore the aggregation structures of rumors, which cannot provide enough discriminative features (especially in the early days of rumors, when the structure of the propagation is incomplete). To solve these problems, this paper proposes a rumor detection method with multimodal feature fusion and enhances the feature representation of the rumor propagation network by adding aggregation features. More specifically, we built a graph model of the propagation structure as well as the aggregation structure. Next, by utilizing the BERT pre-training model and the bidirectional graph convolutional network, we captured the features of text content, propagation structure, and aggregation structure, respectively. Finally, the multimodal features were aggregated based on the attention mechanism, and the final result was obtained through the MLP classifier. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - We present a neural network architecture focused on verifying facts against evidence found in a knowledge base. The architecture can perform relevance evaluation and claim verification, parts of a well-known three-stage method of fact-checking. We fine-tuned BERT to codify claims and pieces of evidence separately. An attention layer between the claim and evidence representation computes alignment scores to identify relevant terms between both. Finally, a classification layer receives the vector representation of claims and evidence and performs the relevance and verification classification. Our model allows a more straightforward interpretation of the predictions than other state-of-the-art models. We use the scores computed within the attention layer to show which evidence spans are more relevant to classify a claim as supported or refuted. Our classification models achieve results compared to the state-of-the-art models in terms of classification of relevance evaluation and claim verification accuracy on the FEVER dataset.

AB  - Political fake news continues to be a threat to contemporary societies, negatively affecting public and democratic institutions. The literature has identified political bias as one of the main predictors of belief and spread of fake news. However, the academic debate has not been consensual regarding the effect of political identity on the discernment of fake news. This systematic literature review (2017–2021) seeks to understand whether there is consistent evidence that one political identity may be more vulnerable to fake news than others. Focusing the analysis on European and North American (United States) studies, we used Scopus and Web of Science databases to examine the literature. Our findings revealed that most studies are consistent in identifying the conservative or right-wing audience as more vulnerable to fake news. Although there seems to be a motivated political reasoning for both sides, left-wing people or liberals were not, in any analyzed study, associated with a greater propensity to believe in political fake news. Motivated reasoning seems stronger and more active among conservatives, both in the United States and Europe. Our study reinforces the need to intensify the fight against the proliferation of fake news among the most conservative, populist, and radical right audience.

AB  - Online content is consumed by most Americans and is a primary source of their news information. It impacts millionsâ€™ perception of the world around them. Problematically, individuals who seek to deceive or manipulate the public can use targeted online content to do so and this content is readily consumed and believed by many. The use of labeling as a way to alert consumers of potential deceptive content has been proposed. This paper looks at factors which impact its perceived trustworthiness and, thus, potential use by Americans and analyzes these factors based on age, education level and gender. This analysis shows that, while labeling and all label types enjoy broad support, the level of support and uncertainty about labeling varies by age and education level with different labels outperforming for given age and education levels. Gender, alternately, was not shown to have a tremendous impact on respondentsâ€™ perspectives regarding labeling; however, females where shown to support labeling more, on average, but also report more uncertainty.

AB  - Literature on influence operations highlights the coordinated actions of digital activists aimed at persuading audiences. Scholars have discussed many angles of this behavior and emphasized repertoires based on specific contentious actions. However, little is discussed about how these disputes allow us to apprehend different models of political action in polarized contexts. On a whole, studies have not considered a broader understanding of digital activism performed by supporters of far-right governments. How does the far-right spread its agenda and support the government in â€œhashtag warsâ€? What kind of strategies are employed? This study seeks to compare patterns of coordinated behavior in hashtags created by supporters and detractors of the Bolsonaro government in Brazil that occupied the trending topics on Twitter. The statistical analysis is based on 6.1 million tweets taken from 20 political hashtags collected over a three-month period from May to July 2020. Data was scraped using Twitterâ€™s Search API v3.0 for academic use. We analyzed the overall volume and peaks of tweets, the users they engaged with, and their network of influence, as well as the length of each hashtag. The results show an intense use of hashtag activism by Bolsonaro supporters, with users struggling for greater prominence in social media in the face of political events in Brazil. This article sheds light on how the far-right appropriates digital platforms to promote the governmentâ€™s public image in times of political tension and how it promotes coordinated actions aimed at framing social media audiences.

AB  - This study sought to investigate factors causing the spread of fake news on digital media (DM) and to explore the sometimes disastrous consequences of fake news on social media. The study also aimed to construct a framework for fake news disaster management to control the dangers of false news on DM. The study applied PRISMA guidelines and techniques for exploring, devising, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search was carried out through 15 of the worldâ€™s leading digital databases. As a result, 31 peer-reviewed studies published in impact-factor journals of leading databases were included. Findings showed that several factors influenced the sharing of fake news on digital media (DM) platforms. Six major trending factors were the rise of technologies, social connections, political reasons, the absence of a controlling center, online business and marketing, and quick dissemination of information. The study identified the disadvantages of fake news (FN) on digital media (DM). A framework was constructed for managing fake news disasters to control the spread of fake news on digital media. This paper offers important theoretical contributions through the development of a framework for controlling fake news spread on digital media and by providing a valuable addition to the existing body of knowledge. The study offers practical assistance to top management, decision makers, and policymakers to devise policies to effectively manage problems caused by fake news dissemination. It provides practical strategies to address fake news disasters on digital media for redefining social values. This research also assists digital media managers in utilizing the proposed framework and controlling the harmful impact of fake news on social media.

Specifically, it looks at how these factors have similar or different impact depending on the income level, political affiliation and online usage time of Americans. A national survey was conducted that asked respondents about multiple factors that influence their and othersâ€™ perception of online content trustworthiness. It also asked what the ideal impact of these factors should be. This data is presented and analyzed herein, conclusions are drawn and their implications, with regard to preventing the spread of deceptive online content, are discussed.

AB  - Based on the assumption that social media encourages a populist style of politics in online communities and the proposition that populism and conspiracy theories tend to co-occur, this article investigates whether this holds true for YouTube influencers, particularly on the less investigated left-wing spectrum. The article provides qualitative case studies of four different groups of political content creators on YouTube whose content makes use of or analyzes popular culture. The article concludes that a populist style plays a far less central role in left-wing communities on YouTube than on other platforms or within right-wing communities.

AB  - Social media is not only an essential platform for the dissemination of public health-related information, but also an important channel for people to communicate during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social bots can interfere with the social media topics that humans follow. We analyzed and visualized Twitter data during the prevalence of the Wuhan lab leak theory and discovered that 29% of the accounts participating in the discussion were social bots. We found evidence that social bots play an essential mediating role in communication networks. Although human accounts have a more direct influence on the information diffusion network, social bots have a more indirect influence. Unverified social bot accounts retweet more, and through multiple levels of diffusion, humans are vulnerable to messages manipulated by bots, driving the spread of unverified messages across social media. These findings show that limiting the use of social bots might be an effective method to minimize the spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech online.

AB  - Efforts have been dedicated by researchers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) to detecting and combating fake news using an assortment of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In this paper, a review of the existing studies is conducted to understand and curtail the dissemination of fake news. Specifically, we conducted a benchmark study using a wide range of (1) classical ML algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB) and an ensemble learning method of such algorithms, (2) advanced ML algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-BiGRU and a hybrid approach of such techniques and (3) DL transformer-based models such as BERTbase and RoBERTabase. The experiments are carried out using different pretrained word embedding methods across four well-known real-world fake news datasets—LIAR, PolitiFact, GossipCop and COVID-19—to examine the performance of different techniques across various datasets. Furthermore, a comparison is made between context-independent embedding methods (e.g., GloVe) and the effectiveness of BERTbase—contextualised representations in detecting fake news. Compared with the state of the artâ€™s results across the used datasets, we achieve better results by solely relying on news text. We hope this study can provide useful insights for researchers working on fake news detection.

AB  - Telegram, an Industry 4.0 style communication service, is one of the worldâ€™s most widespread communication platforms. The availability of channels and bots has opened as a broadcast channel for any media outlet. We asked the following questions: Do media outlets from Spain use Telegram channels? Which media outlets? Are they verified? What is their volume of subscribers? Can this information be used to rank media outlets? We identified many media channels and data were collected from each one. We present the results in a ranking. Forty-two media based in Spain have Telegram channels, 26 of which are ranked in the directory. Less than half of these channels are verified by the platform, and only three are linked to their website. This lack of verification could lead to the proliferation of fake channels. The article ends with a series of recommendations for channel managers to make it easier for the end user to identify and verify each media outlet.

AB  - The study aims to trace the emerging Canadian online discourse resisting COVID-19 official and public health measures and its relationship to far-right ideologies on the alternative platform of BitChute through the analysis of the top watched videos from eight Canadian channels. Employing articulation theory as an analytical prism, it aims to identify: 1) Which organizational/individual identities are associated with the collected accounts and what is their relationship to the far-right? 2) What are the major themes in the videos? 3) What ideologies are associated with these themes? The analysis reveals six key articulations: pseudo-legal actions and language, political conspiracies, medical and scientific language and expertise, war analogies, activist rhetoric and tactics, and family values. These discursive articulations disclose linkages between concepts that are usually contradictory but are bonded together in the conjecture moment of the pandemic. This convergence points to the sophistication and innovativeness of far-right discourse in responding to COVID-19 and to their continuing invocation of older tropes and metaphors that have characterized their ideologies

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this research is to evaluate the extent to which credibility of news sources and fact-checkers individually and jointly influence online users' beliefs and intended behaviors regarding online misinformation. The broader goal is to understand why fact-checking seems to have inconsistent effects on the beliefs and behavioral intentions about disinformation. 10;Design/methodology/approachAn online experiment was conducted in a public health (COVID-19) context with 429 validated participants to test three hypotheses linking the main and interaction effects of two independent variables (news source credibility and fact-checker credibility) on three dependent variables (users' believability, reading intention and sharing intention of online news claims). The data was analyzed using multilevel (fixed effects) models controlling for individual differences, claim differences and order effects.FindingsThe author observed a nuanced pattern of effects; news source credibility had a positive main effect on believability but negative effects on reading and sharing intention; fact-checking credibility had a positive main effect on believability, but no effects on reading or sharing intentions, but negatively moderated the effects of source credibility on all three dependent variables.Originality/valueThis paper introduces, conceptualizes and tests whether a more credible fact-checker shapes the beliefs and intentions about online misinformation differently from less credible fact-checkers, especially when examined concurrently with similar effects of the original sources of misinformation claims. Additionally, it suggests that, on average, users have a low perception of credibility for fact-checkers (even reputed ones), which may explain why fact-checking is often ineffective in shaping the beliefs and intended behaviors.

AB  - The classical account of reasoning posits that analytic thinking weakens belief in COVID-19 misinformation. We tested this account in a demographically representative sample of 742 Australians. Participants completed a performance-based measure of analytic thinking (the Cognitive Reflection Test) and were randomized to groups in which they either rated the perceived accuracy of claims about COVID-19 or indicated whether they would be willing to share these claims. Half of these claims were previously debunked misinformation, and half were statements endorsed by public health agencies. We found that participants with higher analytic thinking levels were less likely to rate COVID-19 misinformation as accurate and were less likely to be willing to share COVID-19 misinformation. These results support the classical account of reasoning for the topic of COVID19 misinformation and extend it to the Australian context.

AB  - People are obtaining more and more information from social media and other online sources, but the spread of misinformation can lead to social disruption. In particular, social networking services (SNSs) can easily spread information of uncertain authenticity and factuality. Although many studies have proposed methods that addressed how to suppress the spread of misinformation on SNSs, few works have examined the impact on society of diffusing both misinformation and its corrective information. This study models the effects of effort to reduce misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it clarifies these effects. With the aim of reducing the impact on social disruption, we show that not only misinformation but also corrective information can cause social disruption, and we clarify how to control the spread of the latter to limit its impact. We analyzed the misinformation about a toilet-paper shortage and its correction as well as the social disruption this event caused in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. First, (1) we analyzed the extent to which misinformation and its corrections spread on SNS, and then (2) we created a model to estimate the impact of misinformation and its corrections on the world. Finally, (3) We used our model to analyze the change in this impact when the diffusion of the misinformation and its corrections changed. Based on our analysis results in (1), the corrective information spread much more widely than the misinformation. From the model developed in (2), the corrective information caused excessive purchasing behavior. The analysis results in (3) show that the amount of corrective information required to minimize the societal impact depends on the amount of misinformation diffusion. Most previous studies concentrated on the impact of corrective information on attitudes toward misinformation. On the other hand, the most significant contribution of this study is that it focuses on the impact of corrective information on society and clarifies the appropriate amount of it.

AB  - A massive â€œinfodemicâ€ developed in parallel with the global COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to public misinformation at a time when access to quality information was crucial. This research aimed to analyze the science and health-related hoaxes that were spread during the pandemic with the objectives of (1) identifying the characteristics of the form and content of such false information, and the platforms used to spread them, and (2) formulating a typology that can be used to classify the different types of hoaxes according to their connection with scientific information. The study was conducted by analyzing the content of hoaxes which were debunked by the three main fact-checking organizations in Spain in the three months following WHOâ€™s announcement of the pandemic (N = 533). The results indicated that science and health content played a prominent role in shaping the spread of these hoaxes during the pandemic. The most common hoaxes on science and health involved information on scientific research or health management, used text, were based on deception, used real sources, were international in scope, and were spread through social networks. Based on the analysis, we proposed a system for classifying science and health-related hoaxes, and identified four types according to their connection to scientific knowledge: â€œhastyâ€ science, decontextualized science, badly interpreted science, and falsehood without a scientific basis. The rampant propagation and widespread availability of disinformation point to the need to foster media and scientific caution and literacy among the public and increase awareness of the importance of timing and substantiation of scientific research. The results can be useful in improving media literacy to face disinformation, and the typology we formulate can help develop future systems for automated detection of health and science-related hoaxes.

AB  - Many people use social media as a primary information source, but their questionable reliability has pushed platforms to contain misinformation via crowdsourced flagging systems. Such systems, however, assume that users are impartial arbiters of truth. This assumption might be unwarranted, as users might be influenced by their own political biases and tolerance for opposing points of view, besides considering the truth value of a news item. In this paper we simulate a scenario in which users on one side of the polarity spectrum have different tolerance levels for the opinions of the other side. We create a model based on some assumptions about online news consumption, including echo chambers, selective exposure, and confirmation bias. A consequence of such a model is that news sources on the opposite side of the intolerant users attract more flags. We extend the base model in two ways: (i) by allowing news sources to find the path of least resistance that leads to a minimization of backlash, and (ii) by allowing users to change their tolerance level in response to a perceived lower tolerance from users on the other side of the spectrum. With these extensions, in the model we see that intolerance is attractive: news sources are nudged to move their polarity to the side of the intolerant users. Such a model does not support high-tolerance regimes: these regimes are out of equilibrium and will converge towards empirically-supported low-tolerance states under the assumption of partisan but rational users.

AB  - Online social media are key platforms for the public to discuss political issues. As a result, researchers have used data from these platforms to analyze public opinions and forecast election results. The literature has shown that due to inauthentic actors such as malicious social bots and trolls, not every message is a genuine expression from a legitimate user. However, the prevalence of inauthentic activities in social data streams is still unclear, making it difficult to gauge biases of analyses based on such data. In this article, we aim to close this gap using Twitter data from the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. We propose an efficient and low-cost method to identify voters on Twitter and systematically compare their behaviors with different random samples of accounts. We find that some accounts flood the public data stream with political content, drowning the voice of the majority of voters. As a result, these hyperactive accounts are over-represented in volume samples. Hyperactive accounts are more likely to exhibit various suspicious behaviors and to share low-credibility information compared to likely voters. Our work provides insights into biased voter characterizations when using social media data to analyze political issues.

AB  - The prevalence and spread of online misinformation during the 2020 US presidential election served to perpetuate a false belief in widespread election fraud. Though much research has focused on how social media platforms connected people to election-related rumors and conspiracy theories, less is known about the search engine pathways that linked users to news content with the potential to undermine trust in elections. In this paper, we present novel data related to the content of political headlines during the 2020 US election period. We scraped over 800,000 headlines from Google's search engine results pages (SERP) in response to 20 election-related keywords—10 general (e.g., "Ballots") and 10 conspiratorial (e.g., "Voter fraud")—when searched from 20 cities across 16 states. We present results from qualitative coding of 5,600 headlines focused on the prevalence of delegitimizing information. Our results reveal that videos (as compared to stories, search results, and advertisements) are the most problematic in terms of exposing users to delegitimizing headlines. We also illustrate how headline content varies when searching from a swing state, adopting a conspiratorial search keyword, or reading from media domains with higher political bias. We conclude with policy recommendations on data transparency that allow researchers to continue to monitor search engines during elections.

AB  - As time flows, the quantity of information, in particular textual content information will increase exponentially. Along with the information, our knowhow of Machine Learning additionally will increase and the computing electricity permits us to teach very complicated and big fashions faster. Fake information has been accumulating loads of interest international recently. The results may be political, economic, organizational, or maybe personal. This paper discusses the oneofakind evaluation of datasets and classifiers technique that's powerful for implementation of Deep gaining knowledge of and system gaining knowledge of that allows you to remedy the problem. Secondary cause of this evaluation on this paper is a faux information detection version that uses ngram evaluation and system gaining knowledge of strategies. We look at and evaluate oneofakind functions extraction strategies and 3 oneofakind system category datasets offer a mechanism for researchers to cope with excessive effect questions that might in any other case be prohibitively steeplypriced and timeingesting to study.

AB  - This article reveals a social perception that may contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Across five studies—including two large-scale samples of Americans and Canadians (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;3395)—we show that people consistently underestimate the risk of contracting the coronavirus from close others (i.e., friends) compared to other groups (e.g., colleagues or strangers). We show that informing people of their (unconscious) preference to believe that friends are less of a threat than strangers can effectively attenuate this tendency. Together, these results provide evidence that peopleâ€™s beliefs about the probability of contracting the coronavirus from their friends are lower than from strangers, which can affect their physical distancing intentions.

AB  - Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer new means for political communications that have quickly begun to play crucial roles in political campaigns, due to their pervasiveness and communication speed. However, the OSN environment is quite slippery and hides potential risks: many studies presented evidence about the presence of d/misinformation campaigns and malicious activities by genuine or automated users, putting at severe risk the efficiency of online and offline political campaigns. This phenomenon is particularly evident during crucial political events, as political elections. In the present paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the networks of interactions among users and bots during the UK elections of 2019. In particular, we focus on the polarised discussion about Brexit on Twitter, analysing a data set made of more than 10 millions tweets posted for over a month. We found that the presence of automated accounts infected the debate particularly in the days before the UK national elections, in which we find a steep increase of bots in the discussion; in the days after the election day, their incidence returned to values similar to the ones observed few weeks before the elections. On the other hand, we found that the number of suspended users (i.e. accounts that were removed by the platform for some violation of the Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it reached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, we observed the injection of a large number of novel bots whose behaviour is markedly different from that of pre-existing ones. Finally, we explored the botsâ€™ political orientation, finding that their activity is spread across the whole political spectrum, although in different proportions, and we studied the different usage of hashtags and URLs by automated accounts and suspended users, targeting the formation of common narratives in different sides of the debate.

AB  - We quantify social media user engagement with low-credibility online news media sources using a simple and intuitive methodology, that we showcase with an empirical case study of the Twitter debate on immigration in Italy. By assigning the Twitter users an Untrustworthiness (U) score based on how frequently they engage with unreliable media outlets and cross-checking it with a qualitative political annotation of the communities, we show that such information consumption is not equally distributed across the Twitter users. Indeed, we identify clusters characterised by a very high presence of accounts that frequently share content from less reliable news sources. The users with high U are more keen to interact with bot-like accounts that tend to inject more unreliable content into the network and to retweet that content. Thus, our methodology applied to this real-world network provides evidence, in an easy and straightforward way, that there is strong interplay between accounts that display higher bot-like activity and users more focused on news from unreliable sources and that this influences the diffusion of this information across the network.

AB  - Botsâ€™ ability to influence public discourse is difficult to estimate. Recent studies found that hyperpartisan bots are unlikely to influence public opinion because bots often interact with already highly polarized users. However, previous studies focused on direct human-bot interactions (e.g., retweets, at-mentions, and likes). The present study suggests that political bots, zealots, and trolls may indirectly affect peopleâ€™s views via a platformâ€™s content recommendation system's mediating role, thus influencing opinions without direct human-bot interaction. Using an agent-based opinion dynamics simulation, we isolated the effect of a single bot—representing 1% of nodes in a network—on the opinion of rational Bayesian agents when a simple recommendation system mediates the agentsâ€™ content consumption. We compare this experimental condition with an identical baseline condition where such a bot is absent. Across conditions, we use the same random seed and a psychologically realistic Bayesian opinion update rule so that conditions remain identical except for the bot presence. Results show that, even with limited direct interactions, the mere presence of the bot is sufficient to shift the average populationâ€™s opinion. Virtually all nodes—not only nodes directly interacting with the bot—shifted towards more extreme opinions. Furthermore, the mere botâ€™s presence significantly affected the internal representation of the recommender system. Overall, these findings offer a proof of concept that bots and hyperpartisan accounts can influence population opinions not only by directly interacting with humans but also by secondary effects, such as shifting platformsâ€™ recommendation enginesâ€™ internal representations. The mediating role of recommender systems creates indirect causal pathways of algorithmic opinion manipulation.

AB  - Due to the exponential increase in internet and social media users, fake news travels rapidly, and no one is immune to its adverse effects. Various machine learning approaches have evaluated text and images to categorize false news over time, but they lack a comprehensive representation of relevant features. This paper presents an automated method for detecting fake news to counteract the spread of disinformation. The proposed multimodal EFND integrates contextual, social context, and visual data from news articles and social media to build a multimodal feature vector with a high level of information density. Using a multimodal factorized bilinear pooling, the gathered features are fused to improve their correlation and offer a more accurate shared representation. Finally, a Multilayer Perceptron is implemented over the shared representation for the classification of fake news. EFND is evaluated using a group of standard fake news datasets known as â€œFakeNewsNetâ€. EFND has outperformed the baseline and state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models. Furthermore, the results of ablation studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed framework. For the PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets, the EFND has achieved an accuracy of 0.988% and 0.990%, respectively.

AB  - Advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of free, large databases have made it possible, even for non-technical people, to either manipulate or generate realistic facial samples for both benign and malicious purposes. DeepFakes refer to face multimedia content, which has been digitally altered or synthetically created using deep neural networks. The paper first outlines the readily available face editing apps and the vulnerability (or performance degradation) of face recognition systems under various face manipulations. Next, this survey presents an overview of the techniques and works that have been carried out in recent years for deepfake and face manipulations. Especially, four kinds of deepfake or face manipulations are reviewed, i.e., identity swap, face reenactment, attribute manipulation, and entire face synthesis. For each category, deepfake or face manipulation generation methods as well as those manipulation detection methods are detailed. Despite significant progress based on traditional and advanced computer vision, artificial intelligence, and physics, there is still a huge arms race surging up between attackers/offenders/adversaries (i.e., DeepFake generation methods) and defenders (i.e., DeepFake detection methods). Thus, open challenges and potential research directions are also discussed. This paper is expected to aid the readers in comprehending deepfake generation and detection mechanisms, together with open issues and future directions.

AB  - The exponential spread of news and posts related to the COVID-19 pandemic on social media platforms led to the emergence of the disinformation phenomenon. The phenomenon of spreading fake information and news creates significant concern for the public health and safety of the population. In this paper, we propose a disinformation detection framework based on multi-task learning (MTL) and meta-heuristic algorithms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The developed framework uses an MTL and a pre-trained transformer-based model to learn and extract contextual feature representations from Arabic social media posts. The extracted contextual representations are fed to an alternative feature selection technique which depends on modified version of the Fire Hawk Optimizer. The proposed framework, which aims to improve the disinformation detection rate, was evaluated on several datasets of Arabic social media posts. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can achieve accuracy of 59%. It obtained, at best, precision, recall, and F-measure of 53%, 71%, and 53%, respectively, on all datasets; and it outperformed the other algorithms in all measures.

AB  - One of todayâ€™s most controversial and consequential issues is whether the global uptake of digital media is causally related to a decline in democracy. We conducted a systematic review of causal and correlational evidence (N&thinsp;=&thinsp;496 articles) on the link between digital media use and different political variables. Some associations, such as increasing political participation and information consumption, are likely to be beneficial for democracy and were often observed in autocracies and emerging democracies. Other associations, such as declining political trust, increasing populism and growing polarization, are likely to be detrimental to democracy and were more pronounced in established democracies. While the impact of digital media on political systems depends on the specific variable and system in question, several variables show clear directions of associations. The evidence calls for research efforts and vigilance by governments and civil societies to better understand, design and regulate the interplay of digital media and democracy.This systematic review on digital media and democracy finds beneficial relationships mostly in emerging democracies but detrimental associations in established democracies for different political variables across methods.

A new approach recently proposed in scholarship and piloted on online platforms is to harness the wisdom of the crowd by enabling recipients of an online message to attach veracity assessments to it. The intention is to allow poor initial crowd reception to temper belief in and further spread of misinformation. We study this approach by letting 4000 subjects in 80 experimental bipartisan communities sequentially rate the veracity of informational messages. We find that in well-mixed communities, the public display of earlier veracity ratings indeed enhances the correct classification of true and false messages by subsequent users. However, crowd intelligence backfires when false information is sequentially rated in ideologically segregated communities. This happens because early ratersâ€™ ideological bias, which is aligned with a message, influences later ratersâ€™ assessments away from the truth. These results suggest that network segregation poses an important problem for community misinformation detection systems that must be accounted for in the design of such systems.

AB  - With the current shift in the mass media landscape from journalistic rigor to social media, personalized social media is becoming the new norm. Although the digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models. We observe that the most important factor for obtaining high accuracy is the document encoding, not the classification model's complexity.

AB  - During New Zealandâ€™s 2020 cannabis legalisation referendum, advocacy groups on both sides widely debated the issue, utilising â€œolderâ€ and â€œnewerâ€ media channels to strategically influence voters, including through appearances in traditional media and paid advertising campaigns on Facebook. Comparatively little is known about the campaign strategies used by each camp and how they leveraged the hybrid media environment to advocate for their positions. We analyse the cannabis legalisation referendum campaigns using primary data from our digital ethnographic study on Facebook, a systematic quantitative content analysis of legacy media websites, and a review of published reports from other authors. We show how positive sentiment towards cannabis law reform in the traditional media was amplified via referendum campaignersâ€™ activity on Facebook. While campaign expenses on both sides were similar, money was spent in different ways and via different mediums. The pro-legalisation campaign focused more on new digital media channels, while the anti-legalisation campaign diversified across a range of mediums, with greater attention paid to traditional political advertising strategies, such as leaflets and billboards. The New Zealand case study illustrates how greater engagement with the â€œnewerâ€ media logics may not necessarily secure a favourable outcome during a national referendum campaign. We discuss how the broader media and political environment may have influenced campaignersâ€™ choices to engage (or not) with the different media channels.

AB  - Social bots have already infiltrated social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and so on. Exploring the role of social bots in discussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as comparing the behavioral differences between social bots and humans, is an important foundation for studying public health opinion dissemination. We collected data on Twitter and used Botometer to classify users into social bots and humans. Machine learning methods were used to analyze the characteristics of topic semantics, sentiment attributes, dissemination intentions, and interaction patterns of humans and social bots. The results show that 22% of these accounts were social bots, while 78% were humans, and there are significant differences in the behavioral characteristics between them. Social bots are more concerned with the topics of public health news than humans are with individual health and daily lives. More than 85% of botsâ€™ tweets are liked, and they have a large number of followers and friends, which means they have influence on internet usersâ€™ perceptions about disease transmission and public health. In addition, social bots, located mainly in Europe and America countries, create an â€œauthoritativeâ€ image by posting a lot of news, which in turn gains more attention and has a significant effect on humans. The findings contribute to understanding the behavioral patterns of new technologies such as social bots and their role in the dissemination of public health information.

T1  - The role of the big geographic sort in online news circulation among U.S. Reddit users
Y1  - 2023
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 6711
KW  - Sciences: Comprehensive Works

KW  - Internet
AB  - Past research has attributed the circulation of online news to two main factors—individual characteristics (e.g., a personâ€™s information literacy) and social media effects (e.g., algorithm-mediated information diffusion)—and has overlooked a third one: the critical mass created by the offline self-segregation of Americans into like-minded geographical regions such as states (a phenomenon called â€˜The Big Sortâ€™). We hypothesized that this latter factor matters for the online spreading of news not least because online interactions, despite having the potential of being global, end up being localized: interaction probability is known to rapidly decay with distance. Upon analysis of more than 8M Reddit comments containing news links spanning four years, from January 2016 to December 2019, we found that Reddit did not work as an â€˜hype machineâ€™ for news (as opposed to what previous work reported for other platforms, circulation was not mainly caused by platform-facilitated network effects). Rather, news circulation in Reddit worked as a supply-and-demand system: news items scaled linearly with the number of users in each state (with a scaling exponent &beta;  &asymp;1, and a goodness of fit R2&asymp;0.95). Furthermore, deviations from such a universal pattern were best explained by state-level personality and cultural factors (R2&asymp;{0.12,0.39}), rather than socioeconomic conditions (R2&asymp;{0.15,0.29}) or political characteristics (R2&asymp;{0.06,0.21}). Higher-than-expected circulation of any type of news was found in states characterised by residents who tend to be less diligent in terms of their personality (low in conscientiousness) and by loose cultures understating the importance of adherence to norms (low in cultural tightness). Interestingly, the combination of those factors with low levels of education was then associated with the circulation of a particular type of news, that is, misinformation. These results suggest that online interactions are geographically bounded and, as such, news circulation cannot be studied purely as an Internet phenomenon but should be grounded into a userâ€™s offline cultural environment, which has become increasingly segregated over the decades, and is admittedly hard to change.

AB  - Fake news detection has become a significant topic based on the fast-spreading and detrimental effects of such news. Many methods based on deep neural networks learn clues from claim content and message propagation structure or temporal information, which have been widely recognized. However, firstly, such models ignore the fact that information quality is uneven in propagation, which makes semantic representations unreliable. Additionally, most models do not fully leverage spatial and temporal structures in combination. Finally, internal decision-making processes and results are non-transparent and unexplained. In this study, we developed a trust-aware evidence reasoning and spatiotemporal feature aggregation model for more interpretable and accurate fake news detection. Specifically, we first designed a trust-aware evidence reasoning module to calculate the credibility of posts based on a random walk model to discover high-quality evidence. Next, from the perspective of spatiotemporal structure, we designed an evidence-representation module to capture the semantic interactions granularly and enhance the reliable representation of evidence. Finally, a two-layer capsule network was designed to aggregate the implicit bias in evidence while capturing the false portions of source information in a transparent and interpretable manner. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed model can provide explanations for fake news detection results, and can also achieve better performance, boosting the F1-score 3.5% on average.

AB  - One of the main tasks in the field of natural language processing (NLP) is the analysis of affective states (sentiment and emotional) based on written text, and attempts have improved dramatically in recent years. However, in studies on the Arabic language, machine learning or deep learning algorithms were utilised to analyse sentiment and emotion more often than current pre-trained language models. Additionally, further pre-training the language model on specific tasks (i.e., within-task and cross-task adaptation) has not yet been investigated for Arabic in general, and for the sentiment and emotion task in particular. In this paper, we adapt a BERT-based Arabic pretrained language model for the sentiment and emotion tasks by further pre-training it on a sentiment and emotion corpus. Hence, we developed five new Arabic models: QST, QSR, QSRT, QE3, and QE6. Five sentiment and two emotion datasets spanning both small- and large-resource settings were used to evaluate the developed models. The adaptation approaches significantly enhanced the performance of seven Arabic sentiment and emotion datasets. The developed models showed excellent improvements over the sentiment and emotion datasets, which ranged from 0.15–4.71%.

AB  - â€œFake newsâ€ was chosen in 2017 as the word of the year by the Collins Dictionary and the American Dialect Society, due to its extraordinary popularity. However, its relevance has been called into question due to its controversy and ambiguity. We have compiled herein 30 definitions from selected dictionaries, academic papers, news agencies, influential media observatories, and independent, certified fact-checkers over the last six years and have carried out a manual relational content analysis on them. We also collected data from four bibliometric studies from academic literature and five surveys on how the general public perceived fake news. In keeping with this three-level systematic review (lexicography, bibliometrics, and public perception) we detected some trends, including a growing drift towards a post-truth-driven conceptualization of fake news. Results also show that the â€œviralâ€ and â€œmemeticâ€ quality of a rumor prevail over the demonstrable credibility of a source and even the factuality of a reported event; the element of surprise or outrage in the heat of the moment is more powerful than the ironic detachment elicited by news satire and parody; and sharing motivations are definitely less concerned with perceived accuracy than with partisan support, community sentiment, emotional contagion, and a taste for the sensational or bizarre.

AB  - Political perspective detection in news media—identifying political bias in news articles—is an essential but challenging low-resource task. Prompt-based learning (i.e., discrete prompting and prompt tuning) achieves promising results in low-resource scenarios by adapting a pre-trained model to handle new tasks. However, these approaches suffer performance degradation when the target task involves a textual domain (e.g., a political domain) different from the pre-training task (e.g., masked language modeling on a general corpus). In this paper, we develop a novel multi-stage prompt tuning framework for political perspective detection. Our method involves two sequential stages: a domain- and task-specific prompt tuning stage. In the first stage, we tune the domain-specific prompts based on a masked political phrase prediction (MP3) task to adjust the language model to the political domain. In the second task-specific prompt tuning stage, we only tune task-specific prompts with a frozen language model and domain-specific prompts for downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms fine-tuning (i.e., model tuning) methods and state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on the SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection and AllSides datasets.

AB  - The inference of politically-oriented information from text data is a popular research topic in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at both text- and author-level. In recent years, studies of this kind have been implemented with the aid of text representations ranging from simple count-based models (e.g., bag-of-words) to sequence-based models built from transformers (e.g., BERT). Despite considerable success, however, we may still ask whether results may be improved further by combining these models with additional text representations. To shed light on this issue, the present work describes a series of experiments to compare a number of strategies for political bias and ideology inference from text data using sequence-based BERT models, syntax-and semantics-driven features, and examines which of these representations (or their combinations) improve overall model accuracy. Results suggest that one particular strategy - namely, the combination of BERT language models with syntactic dependencies - significantly outperforms well-known count- and sequence-based text classifiers alike. In particular, the combined model has been found to improve accuracy across all tasks under consideration, outperforming the SemEval hyperpartisan news detection top-performing system by up to 6%, and outperforming the use of BERT alone by up to 21%, making a potentially strong case for the use of heterogeneous text representations in the present tasks.

AB  - Digital media have become an integral part of the journalism industry and of audience habits – in 2021 our research registered 2873 active news websites in Spain. First, this paper explores trends facing online news; it sets out the criteria used to identify a news brand as digital-native or non-native; and it presents the results of our classification. This includes: data on the presence of news titles both on proprietary platforms (print, radio, TV or app) in addition to their websites, and on external platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Telegram); their geographic scope (hyperlocal, local/regional or national/global); their subject (general or specialized coverage); and on ownership and language used. Almost 70% of the media were regional or local, while 60% covered general news, and one in three were linked to a print product, almost as many as those with their own app for users. Social media uptake is so widespread that more than 95% of the sites are on Facebook, with a similar number on Twitter, while more than 60% can be found on YouTube, and similarly on Instagram. Among specialized sites, sport is the largest category, comprising twice as many digital-native sites (106) than sites with traditional roots (46). The entertainment focus expands in the digital environment, and online-originated culture, business and science and technology outlets also outnumber legacy publications.Alternate abstract:Los medios digitales se han convertido en una parte integral de la industria del periodismo y de los hÃ¡bitos de la audiencia: en 2021, nuestra investigaciÃ³n registrÃ³ 2.873 sitios web de noticias activos en EspaÃ±a.

Entre los resultados, destaca que casi el 70% de los medios eran autonÃ³micos o locales, mientras que el 60% cubrÃ­a noticias generales, y uno de cada tres estaba vinculado a algÃºn producto impreso, casi tantos como los que tenÃ­an app propia para los usuarios. La aceptaciÃ³n de las redes sociales estÃ¡ tan extendida que mÃ¡s del 95% de los medios estÃ¡n en Facebook, un nÃºmero similar estÃ¡n en Twitter y mÃ¡s del 60% se pueden encontrar en YouTube y en Instagram. Entre los sitios especializados, el deporte es la categorÃ­a mÃ¡s grande entre los medios nativos digitales (106), que suponen mÃ¡s del doble de los medios no nativos especializados en esta temÃ¡tica (46). Asimismo, la atenciÃ³n al entretenimiento se amplÃ­a en el entorno digital, y los medios nativos digitales centrados en cultura, negocios y ciencia y tecnologÃ­a superan en nÃºmero a las publicaciones tradicionales.Alternate abstract:Els mitjans digitals sâ€™han convertit en una part integral de la indÃºstria del periodisme i dels hÃ bits de lâ€™audiÃ¨ncia: el 2021, la nostra recerca va registrar 2.873 llocs web de notÃ­cies actius a Espanya.

AB  - Individual factors such as cognitive capacities matter when one is requested to spot fake news. We suggest, however, that social influence—specifically as exercised by an authoritarian leader—might matter more if one is expected to agree with the fake news. We developed a single-item prototype measure of leadership styles and recruited participants from four Western democratic countries (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States, N&thinsp;=&thinsp;501) who identified their immediate boss as an autonomous, paternalistic, or authoritarian leader. Then they were asked to evaluate the accuracy of several fake news articles and their expectations to agree with their boss when asked about these articles. People with authoritarian bosses were less accurate in spotting fake news (Cohenâ€™s d&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.32) compared to employees with autonomous bosses. The bigger effect, however, was that they would agree with their boss about the fake news article when it was shared by their authoritarian boss compared to employees with autonomous (Cohenâ€™s d&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.30) or paternalistic bosses (Cohenâ€™s d&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.70). We argue that in addition to effects on the perceived accuracy of information, social influence, conformity, and obedience are crucial and unacknowledged factors of how misinformation may be maintained and propagated by authoritarian leaders.

AB  - Some major social media companies are announcing plans to tokenize user engagements, derived from blockchain-based decentralized social media. This would bring financial and reputational incentives for engagement, which might lead users to post more objectionable content. Previous research showed that financial or reputational incentives for accuracy decrease the willingness to share misinformation. However, it is unclear to what extent such outcome would change if engagements instead of accuracy were incentivized, which is a more realistic scenario. To address this question, we conducted a survey experiment to examine the effects of hypothetical token incentives. We find that a simple nudge about the possibility of earning token-based points for the achieved user engagements increases the willingness to share different kinds of news, including misinformation. The presence of penalties for objectionable posts diminishes the positive effect of tokenization rewards on misinformation sharing, but it does not eliminate it. These results have policy implications for content moderation practices if platforms embrace decentralization and engagement tokenization.

AB  - The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fostering the development of innovative methods of communication and collaboration. Integrating AI into Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is now ushering in an era of social progress that has the potential to empower marginalized groups. This transformation paves the way to a digital inclusion that could qualitatively empower the online presence of women, particularly in conservative and male-dominated regions. To explore this possibility, we investigated the effect of integrating conversational agents into online debates encompassing 240 Afghans discussing the fall of Kabul in August 2021. We found that the agent leads to quantitative differences in how both genders contribute to the debate by raising issues, presenting ideas, and articulating arguments. We also found increased ideation and reduced inhibition for both genders, particularly females, when interacting exclusively with other females or the agent. The enabling character of the conversational agent reveals an apparatus that could empower women and increase their agency on online platforms.

AB  - Nowadays, the dissemination of news information has become more rapid, liberal, and open to the public. People can find what they want to know more and more easily from a variety of sources, including traditional news outlets and new social media platforms. However, at a time when our lives are glutted with all kinds of news, we cannot help but doubt the veracity and legitimacy of these news sources; meanwhile, we also need to guard against the possible impact of various forms of fake news. To combat the spread of misinformation, more and more researchers have turned to natural language processing (NLP) approaches for effective fake news detection. However, in the face of increasingly serious fake news events, existing detection methods still need to be continuously improved. This study proposes a modified proof-of-concept model named NER-SA, which integrates natural language processing (NLP) and named entity recognition (NER) to conduct the in-domain and cross-domain analysis of fake news detection with the existing three datasets simultaneously. The named entities associated with any particular news event exist in a finite and available evidence pool. Therefore, entities must be mentioned and recognized in this entity bank in any authentic news articles. A piece of fake news inevitably includes only some entitlements in the entity bank. The false information is deliberately fabricated with fictitious, imaginary, and even unreasonable sentences and content. As a result, there must be differences in statements, writing logic, and style between legitimate news and fake news, meaning that it is possible to successfully detect fake news. We developed a mathematical model and used the simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal legitimate area. Comparing the detection performance of the NER-SA model with current state-of-the-art models proposed in other studies, we found that the NER-SA model indeed has superior performance in detecting fake news. For in-domain analysis, the accuracy increased by an average of 8.94% on the LIAR dataset and 19.36% on the fake or real news dataset, while the F1-score increased by an average of 24.04% on the LIAR dataset and 19.36% on the fake or real news dataset. In cross-domain analysis, the accuracy and F1-score for the NER-SA model increased by an average of 28.51% and 24.54%, respectively, across six domains in the FakeNews AMT dataset. The findings and implications of this study are further discussed with regard to their significance for improving accuracy, understanding context, and addressing adversarial attacks. The development of stylometric detection based on NLP approaches using NER techniques can improve the effectiveness and applicability of fake news detection.

AB  - As an integral part of their online strategies and business models, news outlets diffuse their online content on social media platforms such as Facebook to increase traffic. They thereby succumb to the contingencies and constraints of third platforms infamous for their sudden changes in algorithms. In this article, we assess engagement patterns of 140,359 Facebook posts of 17 Belgian news brands between March 2020 and 2021. We map out differences in audience engagement of news outletsâ€™ Facebook posts related and unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic and differences between mainstream and alternative news outlets. We find that COVID-19-related posts generate more engagement and more so for mainstream media than for alternative media outlets.

AB  - With the popularization of digital technology, the problem of information pollution caused by fake news has become more common. Malicious dissemination of harmful, offensive or illegal content may lead to misleading, misunderstanding and social unrest, affecting social stability and sustainable economic development. With the continuous iteration of artificial intelligence technology, researchers have carried out automatic and intelligent news data mining and analysis based on aspects of information characteristics and realized the effective identification of fake news information. However, the current research lacks the application of multidisciplinary knowledge and research on the interpretability of related methods. This paper focuses on the existing fake news detection technology. The survey includes fake news datasets, research methods for fake news detection, general technical models and multimodal related technical methods. The innovation contribution is to discuss the research progress of fake news detection in communication, linguistics, psychology and other disciplines. At the same time, it classifies and summarizes the explainable fake news detection methods and proposes an explainable human-machine-theory triangle communication system, aiming at establishing a people-centered, sustainable human–machine interaction information dissemination system. Finally, we discuss the promising future research topics of fake news detection technology.

AB  - Objective: This brief report explores whether the COVID-19 Pandemic impacted ideal family size in the United States. Background: Although COVID-19 negatively impacted short-term fertility expectations, preferences, and behaviors in the United States, it remains unknown whether the pandemic contributed to changes in family size ideals more broadly. Method: The sample consists of 1823 respondents from the General Social Survey (GSS) who were originally interviewed before the COVID-19 pandemic (in 2016 and 2018) and were re-interviewed in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (in August/September 2020), a period when pandemic-related stress and uncertainty was particularly pronounced. A within-person fixed effects approach is utilized. Results: Findings from within-person fixed effects analyses suggested that the pandemic had no impact on the quantum of ideal family size responses. These findings were robust to alternative specifications and were similar to what was observed in a parallel analysis of how the Great Recession impacted ideal family size. Conclusion: Findings pointed to stability in ideal family size in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Implications: Future work should explore the disjuncture between short-term fertility intentions and behaviors and longer-term family size ideals.

AB  - Detecting media bias is a challenging task due to the complexity and ambiguity of language. Current approaches are limited in their ability to generalise across regions and styles of journalism. This paper proposes a new approach that focusses on detecting rhetorical linguistic techniques rather than just analysing words or contextual representations. We compare three different systems based on different techniques for identifying media bias, including a lexical-based system, a language transformers-based system, and a cascade transformers system that relies on persuasive techniques detection. We have evaluated these systems using a Ukraine crisis news dataset and splitting it by according to the country to generate training and test sets, i.e. different sets for each country. The results of the cascade system outperforms by at least a 6% the other approaches in identifying media bias when evaluating with different countries setup. Our results suggest that models capable of detecting rhetorical and persuasive linguistic techniques are necessary to generalise media bias effectively.Alternate abstract:Detectar sesgo mediÃ¡tico es una tarea desafiante debido a la ambigÃ¼edad del lenguaje.

AB  - Analytical thinking safeguards us against believing or spreading fake news. In various forms, this common assumption has been reported, investigated, or implemented in fake news education programs. Some have associated this assumption with the inverse claim, that distractions from analytical thinking may render us vulnerable to believing or spreading fake news. This paper surveys the research done between 2016 and 2022 on psychological factors influencing oneâ€™s susceptibility to believing or spreading fake news, considers which of the psychological factors are plausible distractors to oneâ€™s exercise of analytical thinking, and discusses some implications of considering them as distractors to analytical thinking. From these, the paper draws five conclusions: (1) It is not analytical thinking per se, but analytical thinking directed to evaluating the truth that safeguards us from believing or spreading fake news. (2) While psychological factors can distract us from exercising analytical thinking and they can also distract us in exercising analytical thinking. (3) Whether a psychological factor functions as a distractor from analytical thinking or in analytical thinking may depend on contextual factors. (4) Measurements of analytical thinking may not indicate vulnerability to believing or spreading fake news. (5) The relevance of motivated reasoning to our tendency to believe fake news should not yet be dismissed. These findings may be useful to guide future research in the intersection of analytical thinking and susceptibility to believing or spreading fake news.
